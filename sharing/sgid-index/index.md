title: Submitting Data to the SGID Index
categories: []

It's quite simple to ~~[deal with a banana fiend](https://youtu.be/F4PZXuk3TsM?t=130)~~ share links to your data with the [SGID Index]({% link sgid/index.html %}#sgid-index).

We use [issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) in our [Porter](https://github.com/agrc/porter/issues) repository on GitHub to track a dataset's progress in the submission process and to keep an open and transparent record of everything that happened.

If you've never used GitHub issues before, click here to watch a short tutorial (TBA) about creating an issue.

If you've still got questions after reading this, {% include contact.html subject="SGID Data Additions" contact=site.data.contacts.sgid text='reach out to ' hide-punctuation=true %}, or anyone else on the [AGRC team]({% link about/contact/index.html %}).

### Step 1: 📋 Qualifications (You)
{: .text-left}

First, make sure your dataset meets the SGID qualifications:

- [General qualifications]({% link about/policy/sgid/index.md %}#general-qualifications)
- [SGID Index-specific qualifications]({% link about/policy/sgid/index.md %}#sgid-index-qualifications)

### Step 2: 📂 Open an Issue (You)
{: .text-left}

Next, [submit an issue](https://github.com/agrc/porter/issues/new/choose) in Porter using the `Add external data links to the SGID Index` template. Fill out the `Summary` information and check the relevant box in the `Submitter's Process` section.

### Step 3: 🔎 Review (You and Us)
{: .text-left}

We will review your submission against the qualifications and reach out with any questions. You can track this in the `AGRC's Process` section of the issue.

### Step 4: 📤 Publish (Us)
{: .text-left}

Once we've worked together to resolve any questions or problems, we'll add your dataset to the SGID Index and close the issue.
