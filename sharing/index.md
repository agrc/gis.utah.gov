AGRC works with partner agencies and local government toward standardization and interoperability of GIS data resources for reliable and consistent information at a statewide level. The SGID products provide a 'one-stop-shop' to make discovery, access, and publishing of GIS data efficient.

Statewide GIS map data layers fulfill a critical need for many personal and organizational business needs. We can help people and organizations connect with your data. With over 30,000 page views and 5,000 static data downloads on our website to 15,000 SGID database table views a month, we can get your data in front of the people who need it.

## There are many ways to participate with the SGID

#### ArcGIS Online and Open Data

{% capture contact %}{% include contact.html subject=page.title contact=site.data.contacts.sgid text="Please reach out to " %}{% endcapture %}

If you have an ArcGIS Online account, we can share authoritative data through our [SGID Open Data](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov) and AGRC website. We put together some [guidelines]({% link sharing/open-data/index.md %}) to help you share effectively to a larger audience. {{ contact }} to start sharing today!

#### AGRC Website and SGID Index

We are very flexible and skilled at building statewide datasets from disparate sources. We can create a data page on the AGRC website from data shared with us from web services (`https://`, `ftp://`, etc), database connections, website solutions like [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) or [ShareFile](https://www.sharefile.com/), or something as simple as an [email attachment]({% link about/contact/index.html %}).

We can link to existing services from our [SGID Index]({% link data/sgid-index/index.html %}) if an entire data page is not appropriate. It is very simple and we hope you take advantage of this great partnership opportunity.

#### SGID Database

{% capture contact %}{% include contact.html subject=page.title contact=site.data.contacts.agrc text="If you work on any of these datasets please get in touch with " hide-punctuation=true %}{% endcapture %}

The SGID database is the source of truth for GIS data in Utah. It stores all of the [most important and vital](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FNCvSQxgQbFG--k3ZapscsTapbrxtSGlKqMcMLCsTYs/edit#gid=0) GIS data. SGID Open Data and mapserv all get their data from this source. Listed below are the core layers we strive to keep current through partnerships with county and local government. {{contact}} so we can help improve Utah GIS data.

### Primary Core Datasets
