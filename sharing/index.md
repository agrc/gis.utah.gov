## Sharing Makes the SGID

The Utah [State Geographic Information Database (SGID)]({% link sgid/index.html%}) is one of the premier statewide GIS data resources in the country, providing clean, consistent, and authoritative data across every geography in the state. People have been turning to the SGID for nearly [30 years]({% link _posts/2019-06-11-sgid-then-and-now.md%}) to support their personal, commercial, academic, and government projects.

Nearly all the data in the SGID that make it such a valuable resource come from cities, counties, and other State agencies. We offer a heartfelt **Thank You!** on behalf of both AGRC and all the users of the SGID to everyone who has contributed to the SGID.

We hope you'll follow the [example]({% link sharing/examples/index.md %}) of our current contributors and consider sharing your data with a broad audience through the SGID. We have three separate "tracks" to follow based on where your data fit best: the **SGID Index**, the **SGID Open Data Hub**, or the **Open SGID**. There's a separate process for contributing to an existing SGID dataset.

## SGID Index
{: .text-left}

The simplest way to share your data is by adding links for existing, qualifying data to the [SGID Index]({% link sgid/index.html %}#sgid-index), which aims to be a database of all statewide GIS resources. If you are hosting GIS resources on your own server, we can link to your datasets in the SGID Index and in the [category pages]({% link data/index.html %}#data-categories) on our website. The category pages help people discover related datasets by grouping data together by topic.

**[Click here]({% link sharing/sgid-index/index.md %}) to start sharing your hosted data with the SGID Index.**

## SGID Open Data Hub

We use Esri's open data offering to maintain [SGID Open Data]({% link sgid/index.html %}#sgid-open-data-site) ([opendata.gis.utah.gov](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov)), a central list of ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise Portal services. This is a great way to use your existing ArcGIS Online or Enterprise infrastructure to share your data with little additional work. We are happy to include any datasets in the SGID Open Data Hub that meet our [qualifications]({% link about/policy/sgid/index.md %}#sgid-open-data-qualifications).

## Open SGID
{: .text-left}

The [Open SGID]({% link sgid/index.html %}#open-sgid) is a curated, publicly-accessible database of statewide GIS layersâ€”the latest evolution of the traditional "SGID as a single geospatial database" model. We are excited to have this connection available to everyone once again.

If you have a statewide dataset but don't have the ability to host or share it yourself, we may host it in the Open SGID if it meets our [qualifications]({% link about/policy/sgid/index.md %}#open-sgid-qualifications). We also share most Open SGID layers through [opendata.gis.utah.gov](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov) (by first uploading it as a feature service in our ArcGIS Online [organization](https://utah.maps.arcgis.com)).

Maintaining data in the Open SGID requires the most work, both on the front end and for long-term maintenance. We encourage you to share your data via SGID Open Data or the SGID Index whenever possible. However, in order to maintain consistency and familiarity with previous versions of the SGID geodatabase, we may add some datasets to Open SGID that are otherwise better suited for SGID Open Data or the SGID Index. This is done at our discretion according to our [policies]({% link about/policy/sgid/index.md %}#open-sgid-qualifications).

**[Click here]({% link sharing/open-sgid/index.md %}) to share your data with us for inclusion in the Open SGID.**

## Contributing to an Existing SGID Dataset
{: .text-left}

If you are the local authoritative source for data contained in an existing dataset, we'd love to work with you to pull your latest data into the SGID. Many of our [most popular datasets]({% link sharing/examples/index.md%}) are the result of collaboration with cities and counties. We will evaluate independent, crowd-sourced or commercial contributions on a case-by-case basis to make sure they are authoritative and not substantially restricted.

To contribute to an existing dataset, please use the contact info listed on the dataset's [data page]({% link data/index.html %}).
