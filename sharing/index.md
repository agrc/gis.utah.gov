## Sharing Makes the SGID

The Utah [State Geographic Information Database (SGID)]({% link sgid/index.html%}) is one of the premier statewide GIS data resources in the country, providing clean, consistent, and authoritative data across every geography in the state. People have been turning to the SGID for nearly [30 years]({% link _posts/2019-06-11-sgid-then-and-now.md%}) to support their personal, commercial, academic, and government projects.

Nearly all the data in the SGID that make it such a valuable resource come from cities, counties, and other State agencies. We offer a heartfelt **Thank You!** on behalf of ourselves and all our users to everyone who has contributed to the SGID.

We hope you'll follow the example of our [current contributors]({% link sharing/examples/index.md %}) and consider sharing your data with a broad audience through the SGID. We have three separate "tracks" to follow based on where your data fit best: the **SGID Index**, the **SGID Open Data Hub**, or the **Open SGID**. There's also a fourth track for contributing to an existing SGID dataset.

## SGID Index
{: .text-left}

The simplest way to share your data is by adding links for existing, qualifying data to the [SGID Index]({% link data/sgid-index/index.html %}), which aims to be a database of all statewide GIS resources. If you are hosting GIS resources on your own server, we can link to your datasets in the SGID Index and in the category pages on our website. The category pages help people discover related datasets by grouping data together by topic.

## SGID Open Data Hub

We use Esri's open data offering to maintain [opendata.gis.utah.gov](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov), a central list of ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise Portal services. This is a great way to use your existing ArcGIS Online or Enterprise infrastructure to share your data with little additional work. We are happy to include any datasets in the SGID Open Data Hub that meet our [qualifications]({% link about/policy/sgid/index.md %}#open-data-qualifications).

## Open SGID

Do you have a statewide dataset but don't have the ability to host or share it yourself? If it meets our [qualifications]({% link about/policy/sgid/index.md %}#open-sgid-qualifications), we will host it in our [Open SGID]({% link sgid/open-sgid/index.md %}) database and share it through [opendata.gis.utah.gov](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov) (by first uploading it as a feature service in our ArcGIS Online [organization](https://utah.maps.arcgis.com)). The Open SGID is built on open source database technology (Postgres) and is available to anyone with an internet connection via a wide variety of software.

## Contributing to an Existing SGID Dataset

If you are the local authoritative source for data contained in an existing dataset, we'd love to work with you to pull your latest data into the SGID. Many of our [most popular datasets]({% link sharing/examples/index.md%}) are the result of collaboration with cities and counties. We will evaluate independent, crowd-sourced or commercial contributions on a case-by-case basis to make sure they are authoritative and not substantially restricted.
