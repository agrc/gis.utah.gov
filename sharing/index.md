## Sharing Makes the SGID

The Utah [State Geographic Information Database (SGID)]({% link sgid/index.html%}) is one of the premier statewide GIS data resources in the country, providing clean, consistent, and authoritative data across every geography in the state. People have been turning to the SGID for nearly [30 years]({% link _posts/2019-06-11-sgid-then-and-now.md%}) to support their personal, commercial, academic, and government projects.

Nearly all the data in the SGID that make it such a valuable resource come from cities, counties, and other State agencies. We offer a heartfelt **Thank You!** on behalf of ourselves and all our users to everyone who has contributed to the SGID.

We hope you'll consider sharing your data with a broad audience through the SGID. We have three separate "tracks" to follow based on where your data fit best: the SGID Index, Open Data, or the Open SGID. There's also a fourth track for contributing to an existing SGID dataset.

## SGID Index
{: .text-left}

The simplest way to share your data is by adding links for existing, qualifying data to the [SGID Index]({% link data/sgid-index/index.html %}), which aims to be a database of all statewide GIS resources. If you are hosting GIS resources on your own server, we can link to your datasets in the SGID Index and in the category pages on our website. The category pages help people discover related datasets by grouping data together by topic.

## Open Data
{: .text-left}

We use Esri's Open Data offering to maintain [opendata.gis.utah.gov](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov), a central list of ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise Portal services. This is a great way to use your existing ArcGIS Online or Enterprise infrastructure to share your data with little additional work. We are happy to include any datasets in our Open Data site that meet our [Open Data policies]({% link about/policy/sgid/index.md %}#open-data-qualifications).

Do you have a statewide dataset but don't have the ability to host or share it yourself? If it meets our [criteria]({% link about/policy/sgid/index.md %}#open-sgid-qualifications), we will host it in our [Open SGID]({% link sgid/open-sgid/index.md %}) database and share it through [opendata.gis.utah.gov](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov) (by first uploading it as a feature service in our ArcGIS Online [organization](https://utah.maps.arcgis.com)). The Open SGID is built on open source database technology (Postgres) and is available to anyone with an internet connection via a wide variety of software.

## Contributing to an Existing SGID Dataset

If you are the local authoritative source for data contained in an existing dataset, we'd love to work with you to pull your latest data into the SGID. Many of our most popular datasets (link to "gold star" page) are the result of collaboration with cities and counties. We will evaluate independent, crowd-sourced or commercial contributions on a case-by-case basis to make sure they are authoritative and not substantially restricted.

Many of our most popular datasets—[roads]({% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}#RoadCenterlines), [parcels]({% link data/cadastre/parcels/index.html %}#UtahParcels), [address points]({% link data/location/address-data/index.html %}#AddressPoints)—depend on the cities and counties, who send us updated data on a regular basis. We then merge them into unified, state-wide datasets available to anyone, free of charge. Most counties also participate in the [Land Information Record]({% link data/cadastre/parcels/index.html %}#UtahLIRParcels) project, providing detailed parcel information that is critical to coherent and coordinated regional planning and analysis.

Many state agencies have taken advantage of the SGID to share important data with a broad audience. Numerous individuals, businesses, and municipalities use [natural hazard layers]({% link data/geoscience/index.html %}) from the Utah Geological Survey and [land ownership boundaries]({% link data/cadastre/land-ownership/index.html %}) from the State Institutional Trust Lands Administration for site selection and analysis.

We offer a heartfelt **Thank You!** on behalf of ourselves and all our users to the communities, agencies, and individuals who have contributed to the SGID.

We have data of our own to share, too! Under the direction of the Lieutenant Governor's office, we map all the changes to city boundaries from annexations, incorporations, and disconnections to create a statewide [municipal boundary]({% link data/boundaries/citycountystate/index.html %}#MunicipalBoundaries) dataset. We also coordinate among various state and federal agencies to collect [Lidar]({% link data/elevation-and-terrain/index.html %}#LiDAR) data for as much of the state as possible. Finally, with the support of the state legislature and cities and counties across the state, we spearhead the acquisition of state-wide, [high-resolution aerial imagery]({% link data/aerial-photography/index.html %}).

## Join the party!

We hope you'll join us in our goal to make as much GIS data as possible available to the broadest audience we can by sharing your data with the SGID. Please see the [**sharing process page**]({% link sharing/process/index.md %}) for instructions to share your data with the SGID in the places listed below.
