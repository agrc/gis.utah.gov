![GIS Data Samples]({% link images/DataRequest.png %}){: style="width:50%; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display:block" loading="lazy" }

## Parcels - Collaboration
{: .text-left}

Our state-wide [parcel boundary dataset]({% link data/cadastre/parcels/index.html %}#UtahParcels) is the most-visited data page on our website, and for good reasonâ€”property boundaries (even the rough, un-surveyed approximations in GIS) are a foundational layer for many maps. They facilitate both commercial activity and private property management.

This statewide collection would not be possible without the cooperation of counties across the state who send us updates to their parcel data on a regular basis. We merge them into a single, consistent dataset available to anyone for free.

## Roads - Collaboration
{: .text-left}

Free, up-to-date, and comprehensive [road data]({% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}#RoadCenterlines) is a luxury we are fortunate to have. Thanks to the contributions of cities, counties, and UDOT, cartographers and analysts don't need to download road data from five different places with five different schemas, nor do they need to pay a commercial company to access data their tax dollars have already paid for. It's all here in one dataset.

## Land Ownership - Sharing
{: .text-left}

Sometimes a project needs a 50,000-foot view of land ownership, especially in Utah where land could be owned by private individuals, the State, or the Federal Government. Utah's State Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) has been tasked with maintaining a state-wide [land ownership layer]({% link data/cadastre/land-ownership/index.html%}#LandOwnership) as part of their responsibilities, which they share on their [website](https://trustlands.utah.gov/resources/maps/). Because this is such a fundamental dataset, SITLA also shares the data with the Open SGID for easy access to all.

## Natural Hazards - Sharing
{: .text-left}

A key part of the land development process is identifying any natural hazards that may impact a project. In the past, we have hosted the Utah Geological Survey's [natural hazard layers]({% link data/geoscience/index.html %}) in the precursor to the Open SGID database. However, making a copy of their data introduced the burden of keeping the SGID data up-to-date with their internal data as they constantly work to map hazards in new areas.

We've worked with UGS to remove the data from the Open SGID and instead share their ArcGIS Online feature services with [SGID Open Data](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov). This sharing method ensures there is only one copy of the data and you see the edits and updates as soon as UGS makes them.

## Historical Aerial Imagery - Sharing

The Utah Geological Survey has also spearheaded the monumental task of scanning and roughly locating all the historic imagery they could find. These scans give a glimpse into the past and are useful to track changes in land use over time. We help make them discoverable by sharing the link to their interactive map on our [aerial photography data page]({% link data/aerial-photography/index.html%}#UGS).

## AGRC-Created Collaborative Datasets
{: .text-left}

Some collaboration takes the form of support for AGRC-created datasets. Under the direction of the Lieutenant Governor's office, we map all the changes to city boundaries from annexations, incorporations, and disconnections to create a statewide [municipal boundary]({% link data/boundaries/citycountystate/index.html %}#MunicipalBoundaries) dataset. We also coordinate among various state and federal agencies to collect [Lidar]({% link data/elevation-and-terrain/index.html %}#LiDAR) data for as much of the state as possible. Finally, with the support of the state legislature and cities and counties across the state, we spearhead the acquisition of state-wide, [high-resolution aerial imagery]({% link data/aerial-photography/index.html %}).
