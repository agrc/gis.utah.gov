    <h4>Getting Here by Car</h4>
    <p>If you're arriving by car, use either the 3500 South or 4700 South exits on the west side I-215 belt route and then turn onto 2700 West. The TSOB is on the east side of the road at approximately 4300 South. You can park in either of the lots west of the building.</p>

    <h4>Getting Here by Transit</h4>
    <p>The Utah Transit Authority <a href="https://www.rideuta.com/Rider-Tools/Schedules-and-Maps/704-Green-Line">Green Line</a> light rail service runs from downtown to the West Valley City offices and Valley Fair Mall about 1.5 miles north of the TSOB (or about a 30 minute walk). <a href="https://www.rideuta.com/Rider-Tools/Schedules-and-Maps/227-2700-West">Bus route 227</a> runs along 2700 West between the Green and Red Lines (3600 South to 8300 South) on an hourly basis, and <a href="https://www.rideuta.com/Rider-Tools/Schedules-and-Maps/47-4700-South">route 47</a> starts at the Murray Central Trax/FrontRunner station every half hour and has a stop at 4700 South and 2700 West, a 3/4-mile (15 minute) walk from the TSOB.</p>

  <div class="grid__col grid__col--1-of-2">
    <h4>Getting Here by Bike</h4>
    <p>If you want to bike in, 3900 South/4100 South is a good east-west route with fairly wide shoulders between the Jordan River Parkway and 2700 West. 2700 West itself has decent bike lanes except for the pinch points around the 4700 South intersection or the light rail tracks around 3300 South but is otherwise a great north-south route.</p>

    <h4>Checking In</h4>
    <p>Once you arrive, check in at the main (west) entrance. Someone will come down and escort you to our offices.</p>
