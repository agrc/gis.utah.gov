### About Geographic Data

Geographic data attempts to model real world phenomena and their locational signature in a digital format. Different data storage strategies are used for geographic data depending on how it was collected and what it represents. There are two major data format categories for GIS data are:

##### Vector

Geographic features are represented by discrete points, lines, and polygons. Generally speaking, vector data is usually used to describe features such as roads, municipal boundaries (such as cities or counties), springs, streams, airports, etc. Common formats include shapefile, geodatabase, kml, gml, geoJSON, computer aided design (CAD),

##### Raster

Raster data sets, which represent geographic phenomena using a grid of raster cells or pixels, is usually collected from satellite or other remotely-sensed or pixel-based data. This includes aerial photos, digital elevation models, scanned images of paper maps, pre-rendered map image tiles, etc. For thematic data, raster is particularly useful for data that lacks a well-defined borders like soil and vegetation types, climate zones, elevation, etc. Common file formats include JPG, GeoTIFF, PNG, ESRI Grid, DEM, and IMG.


##### Metadata

To facilitate appropriate utilization, best practices dictate that metadata accompany geographic data files and services. Metadata can take the form of FGDC, ISO, ArcMap formats as well as other techniques. Be sure to read and consider our [best practice guide for effective metadata]({{ "/gis-data-sharing/metadata/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
