The following Data Sharing Agreement applies to all individuals and organizations sharing data with the SGID in any way.

You consent to this Data Sharing Agreement when you submit a [Porter issue](https://github.com/agrc/porter/issues/new?assignees=%40steveoh%2C+%40gregbunce%2C+%40rkelson&labels=introduction%2C+porter&template=1-introduce-sgid-dataset.md&title=Add+%3Cdataset+name%3E+from+%3Csource%3E) to introduce your data to the SGID. In cases where UGRC submits the Porter issue on your behalf, UGRC will contact you via email to get your consent to this agreement. If you need to discuss different GRAMA/license/disclaimer terms, please note this in the Porter issue.

## Definitions

**"Aggregate data"** refers to any data that cover a specific area of the state and are provided by another organization (such as a city or county) for UGRC to combine with other similar data into statewide datasets.

**"External data"** refers to any data stored or hosted by a person or organization outside of UGRC.

**"Hosted data"** refers to any data stored, maintained, and served by UGRC, whether created by UGRC or provided by another organization. It may include aggregate data.

**"SGID entry"** refers to any of the following:

1. Links in the SGID Index to external data
1. Links and references in [opendata.gis.utah.gov](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov) to external data in the form of ArcGIS Online items owned by other organizations
1. Hosted data in the Open SGID
1. Hosted data in UGRC's ArcGIS Online organization that are shared with an SGID ArcGIS Online group or the "AGRC Shelf" group

The **"steward"** refers to the individual or organization that shares data with UGRC for inclusion in the SGID.

## General Provisions
