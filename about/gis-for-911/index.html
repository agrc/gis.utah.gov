<h2>Utah Mapping Data and Services in Support of 911 and Emergency Response</h2>
<p>A portion of the emergency response (911) - related mapping data and services maintained by AGRC are funded through the State's 911 restricted fund. According to State statute:</p>

<p>Additionally, State law specifies that the State Geographic Information Database (SGID), managed by AGRC, is the central clearinghouse for geospatial data. The SGID  includes road centerline, address data, boundary, ownership, aerial photography, and base map services that are utilized by local, state, federal, and tribal agencies across Utah.</p>
<p>AGRC provides coordination, data integration, and quality assurance to bring local data together and make it functional as a statewide map data layer. Additionally, AGRC staff have provided technical assistance to local PSAPs and jurisdictions in support of improved data resources and technical expertise.</p>
<p>AGRC also participates in the Utah 911 Committee's monthly meetings and stays abreast to GIS-related activities that involve or impact the Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) throughout the state.
