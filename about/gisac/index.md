### Be Known, Be Found, Be Seen

As a part of our effort to build a statewide directory of GIS professionals we have created a form to collect your information. Please [register](https://forms.gle/ea6iPCQ72xwEkRR18) to become a part of this public GIS professional directory.

### Share Your Skills and Experience

To best understand and document the skills and experiences of Utah GIS professionals, GISAC has created a [form](https://forms.gle/NqozmhkBsra9Ehfk9)[^1] to aid the creation of an inventory of technical GIS-related products, including software, hardware, SaaS, and PaaS, that agencies have or are using. With the data collected through the form, GISAC can help spread relevant information to assist decision-makers when they are building or deploying GIS solutions. Please complete the [form](https://forms.gle/NqozmhkBsra9Ehfk9)[^1] to help create this resource.
