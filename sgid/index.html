        <h2>The State Geographic Information Database</h2>
        <p class="readable">Established by State law in 1991, Utah’s State Geographic Information Database (SGID) provides a centralized collection of hundreds of GIS data layers developed, aggregated, or acquired by the State. Evolving technologies have allowed us to transform the SGID from a single database to a broad collection of data resources under the SGID umbrella. It contains both AGRC-curated datasets and references to data from a wide variety of state and local agencies. Many resources have both download links and links to web services for direct consumption.</p>

        <p class="readable">There are many pieces, or facets, to the SGID today, with each one addressing specific audiences or technologies. The SGID Index combines all of these along with links to externally-hosted resources to make it easy to find the latest and highest quality GIS data resources no matter where they're hosted.

        <p class="readable">Click or scroll to read more about each facet of the SGID:</p>
