        For UGRC staff, when you have an idea for a new blog post, please fill out the following form.
        After submitting this issue, GitHub will create:

        1. a new branch for you to work on the blog post,
        1. a new markdown file in the `/src/content/blog` directory with the correct date and title you provide,
        1. a new folder in the `/src/pillar-blog` directory with the same title you provide,

        Find your file in the new branch and start writing your blog post. Add images to the new folder created for you.
        When you're ready to publish, create a pull request.

        This process will help us remove file naming and location issues as well as keep track of ideas to ensure
        that we're writing about the right topics.
