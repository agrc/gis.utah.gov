Seems like 2023 is flying, we’re already into October and fall is here. It has been a quiet summer for annexations, most folks were dealing with the special election. Did have a few and once again Utah County led the way. 
Be sure to check out all the changes that have been made, and to make sure your boundaries are where they should be, view them on the [Utah Municipality Modifications map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63). All recent annexation documents can be viewed here: [Utah Lt. Governor Municipal Certifications](https://demosite.utah.gov/gov-entity/boundary-certifications-by-year/) website. This website is still in a transition phase so it may change in the future.
