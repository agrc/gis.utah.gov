It seems like 2023 is flying by; We're already into October and fall is here. It has been a quiet summer for annexations, presumably most folks were dealing with the special election. Utah did have a few annexations and once again Utah County led the way.

Be sure to check out all the changes that have been made and to make sure your boundaries are where they should be. Wiew them on the [Utah Municipality Modifications map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63). All recent annexation documents can be viewed on the [Utah Lt. Governor Municipal Certifications](https://demosite.utah.gov/gov-entity/boundary-certifications-by-year/) website. This website is still in a transition phase so it may change in the future.

The following table shows the changes and annexations (listed by county and city) since July  1, 2023:
