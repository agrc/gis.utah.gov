This event, in its fourth year, is a good opportunity for students and professionals to share maps, mapping tools, and mapping projects with elected officials, fellow practitioners, and the public.</p>
<p><em>Who should participate:</em><br />
Individuals: Anybody who makes a map through their work or education.<br />
Organizations: An organization that has worked on multiple mapping projects.</p>
<p><em>Maps on the Hill Event:</em><br />
The map display event will be held the first Wednesday of the 2015 Legislative session, in the Capitol Rotunda from 10:30 am - 1:30 pm, with set-up time beginning at 9:30am. We request that at least one participant is present to discuss each map entry throughout the display event.</p>
<p><em>Display Types:</em><br />
You can present hardcopy maps, interactive digital maps (you’ll need to provide a means to show it on a computer), or both.<br />
The focus of the event is interesting maps or map technology projects that are applicable to a wide audience. While displays can be on any appropriate topic, presentations that may be of interest to decision makers are strongly encouraged. Marketing of specific product and services is discouraged.</p>
