<p>The latest version of the Municipal Boundaries layer is now available in SGID93, SGID10, and download via FTP. It was updated on Oct 10, 2012 and includes all new annexations for 2012 from the Lt. Governor’s web site through October 1. These updates include 30 Annexations, 1 Disconnection, and 1 Adjustment. The most recent changes were made in Box Elder (Brigham City, Plymouth, Tremonton); Cache (Amalga Town, Hyde Park, Hyrum, Logan, Milleville, Providence, Wellsville); Davis (Layton, Syracuse), Salt Lake (Cottonwood Heights), Utah (Spring City). In addition, the FIPS field was changed to a text field to support values that contained leading zeros. The FIPS code is a 5-digit number, one-third of the counties have a zero or two in front as part of their official code.</p>
<p>A new Municipalities_Modifications layer was also added to the SGID as well. It includes all boundary information collected to date for municipalities (Annexations, Disconnections, Adjustments, and incorporations), from the Lt. Governor’s web site, and those supplied by county and city contacts. This data set is intended to track municiple boundary changes over time and link to additional documentation when available. While there are quite a few entries, not every change is represented, and some counties/cities are more complete than others.</p>
