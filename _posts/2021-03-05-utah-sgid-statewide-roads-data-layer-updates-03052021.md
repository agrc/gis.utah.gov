AGRC recently completed updates to the SGID Roads feature class. Please visit our [Roads and Highway System]({% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}) data page where you will find information about the Roads data model, as well as direct download links to the SGID Roads data in shapefile and geodatabase format.

These updates are also reflected in AGRC's [address locators]({% link data/address-geocoders-locators/index.html %}), Utah's [Next-Generation 911 GIS database]({% link data/911/index.html %}), and AGRC's [street network analysis datasets]({% link data/transportation/street-network-analysis/index.html %}).

The following are highlights from this month's update.
