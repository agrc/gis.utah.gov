It is the end of the year and here is the final tally for Annexations in 2017. The total number of Annexations and Disconnections processed this year is on par with last year at 89.

We have another new city down in Iron County, Cedar Highlands, on the east side of Cedar City in the foothills.

The county with the most changes is Utah County again. The City with the most is a tie, both American Fork and Layton had 7.

Thanks to all the City and County personal who are responsible for this work.

Another reminder the 2020 Census will be coming up soon so it’s a good time to review your data and get any missing areas included. We will be submitting data to Census BAS program again early in the new year. They like to see documentation of some kind for all areas included.
