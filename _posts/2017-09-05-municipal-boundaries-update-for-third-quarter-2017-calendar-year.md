Heading into fall now, everyone seems to be getting things in order for the end of the year. 
We have been working with some cities and counties to get some older areas updated and boundaries current.
The 2020 Census will be coming up soon so it’s a good time to review your data and get any missing areas included. We will be submitting data to Census BAS program again at the end of the year, they do like to see documentation of some kind for all areas included. Current data can be downloaded from the data page State, County, and Municipal Boundaries ( https://gis.utah.gov/data/boundaries/citycountystate/ ). 
Or you can contact us for more information mheagin@utah.gov, agrc@utah.gov
