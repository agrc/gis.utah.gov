<p>Tags play an important role in search optimization in both ArcGIS Online and Esri's newly released Open Data platform.</p>
<p>The creation of this draft was driven by AGRC preparations for the GIS data resources in Utah's State Geographic Information Database (SGID) to work optimally these two and other environments.</p>
<p>Feedback on the best practices document is encouraged and can be provided within the google doc by right clicking and selecting 'Comment'. Thank you in advance for your input!</p>
