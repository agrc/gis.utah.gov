UGRC recently completed updates to the SGID Roads feature class. Please visit our [Roads and Highway System]({% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}) data page where you will find information about the Roads data model, as well as direct download links to the SGID Roads data in shapefile and geodatabase format.

These updates are also reflected in UGRC's [address locators]({% link data/address-geocoders-locators/index.html %}), Utah's [Next-Generation 911 GIS database]({% link data/911/index.html %}), and UGRC's [street network analysis datasets]({% link data/transportation/street-network-analysis/index.html %}).

The following are highlights from this month's update.

#### County Updates

New roads were added and road names and address ranges were updated for the following counties:

- **Cache County:** Obtained roads data on 08/17/2021. Previous update was on 06/04/2021.
- **Davis County:** Obtained roads data on 08/19/2021. Previous update was on 08/06/2021.
