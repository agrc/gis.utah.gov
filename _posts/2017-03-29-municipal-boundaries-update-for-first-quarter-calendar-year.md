Municipal Boundaries update for first quarter 2017 (calendar year)

Wow! Already three months in the new year, it seems to be moving along fast.
Not a whole lot of changes so far. We’ve been working with Cache County (thanks Cherie) to clear up a few discrepancies in their boundaries. Everything looks great now.
Just a reminder to everyone, if you see something that’s not correct let us know, we’ll work to get it right.

Following are the changes and annexations since Dec. 31, 2016 listed by County and City:

| County | City | Number of Changes |

| Box Elder | Fielding | 1 |
| Cache | Hyrum | 1 |
| | Hyde Park | 1 |
| | Logan | 1 |
| | Logan, River Heights Adjustment | 1 |
| | Nibley | 1 |
| | Richmond Disconnection | 1 |
| Davis | West Bountiful | 1 |
| Duchesne | Roosevelt | 1 |
