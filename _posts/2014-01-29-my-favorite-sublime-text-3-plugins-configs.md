<p>I'm a huge fan of <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a>. I love it's simplicity and strong package community. Here's a list of my favorite packages and config tweaks:</p>
<h3>
Packages</h3>
<p><a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/installation">Package Control</a>&nbsp;- This enables you to easily search for and install packages. This is always the first thing that I do with a new install of Sublime.<br />
<a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/AdvancedNewFile">AdvancedNewFile</a> - Best way to create new files.<br />
<a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Auto%20Semi-Colon">Auto Semi-colon</a> - Add a semi-colon to the end of a line even if your cursor isn't at the end of the line.<br />
<a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/All%20Autocomplete">All Autocomplete</a> - Adds autocomplete for words found in all open files. Works well as a supplement to SublimeCodeIntel<br />
<a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Emmet">Emmet</a> - Awesome shorthand for creating HTML markup. As an added bonus it forces you to learn to write CSS selectors better.<br />
<a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/GitGutter">GitGutter</a> - See which lines have been changed since your last commit.<br />
<a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/Markdown%20Preview">Markdown Preview</a> - Allows your to preview markdown docs in your browser.<br />
<a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/TrailingSpaces">TrailingSpaces</a> - Kill all trailing spaces in the current file.<br />
<a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeCodeIntel">Sublime Code Intel</a> - Auto complete awesomeness<br />
<a href="https://sublime.wbond.net/packages/SublimeLinter">Sublime Linter</a> - Lints all sorts of languages. I use it to auto-run jsHint on my files. So useful to see lint errors as I'm coding.<br />
<a href="https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-git">Sublime-text-git</a> - Have to manually clone and checkout python3 branch to get this to work in sublime text 3. It's a bit of a pain but worth it.</p>

<p>Notice that Vintage does not show up in my ignored_packages and I even have it default to start in <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/3/vintage.html">vintage command mode</a>. I made this switch about a year ago and have never looked back. I really feel like I am more efficient getting around and editing code.</p>
<p>I've had a few people ask me about my Sublime setup and wanted to get it out there. Any cool stuff that I'm missing?</p>
