Updated roads data is also available as shapefiles and file geodatabase files for download on the [SGID Roads and Highway System download page]({% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}).

These updates are also reflected in [UGRC's address locators]({% link data/address-geocoders-locators/index.html %}) and the [Utah Next-Generation 911 GIS Database]({% link data/911/index.html %}).
