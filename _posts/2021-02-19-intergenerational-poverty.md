### Poverty and Place
{: .text-left}

We now know that poverty and place are connected. [Numerous studies](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/upshot/an-atlas-of-upward-mobility-shows-paths-out-of-poverty.html) point to evidence showing that place matters a great deal to an individual’s economic outlook. This is particularly true for children.

Moreover, [research](http://www.equality-of-opportunity.org/images/nbhds_exec_summary.pdf) shows that children growing up in poverty are more likely to remain in poverty. But, children who move -particularly before their teenage years- to neighborhoods with more opportunity have a much better chance of breaking the cycle.

This tells us two things: that neighborhoods play a significant role in the pattern of [intergenerational poverty](https://jobs.utah.gov/edo/intergenerational/index.html) and that neighborhoods with better services and more opportunities provide residents a greater chance to succeed. 

While it might be possible for some families to relocate to better areas, it’s more practical to improve services in underserved neighborhoods. 

Ultimately, the goal is to provide residents a viable path to upward economic mobility. Generally speaking, this includes access to quality schools, healthcare, mixed housing, and sustainable jobs. Services such as safe and reliable transportation also play a major role.

### GIS as a Community Tool

[Identifying areas](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/05/03/upshot/the-best-and-worst-places-to-grow-up-how-your-area-compares.html) in the community that provide or lack these services is an essential step to creating a path forward. Geographic information systems (GIS) are well suited for this task. Using GIS, we are able to visualize the data as layers in a map. Combining the layers into one system allows us to spatially analyze the data together and ask questions such as “What areas in our community are best suited for a new charter school?”, or “Based on recent growth, where do we need to expand healthcare and transit services?”.

Using spatial tools like suitability analysis (shown in Figure 1), we can highlight areas on a map that meet these specific criteria. The more layers we add, the bigger the questions we can ask. This is powerful when looking at complex issues such as [intergenerational poverty](https://jobs.utah.gov/edo/intergenerational/whatisigp.pdf).

To see Figure 1 in action, take a look [AGRC’s interactive neighborhood suitability analysis map]({% link developer/applications/suitability/index.html %}). The layers in this map give the user the ability to explore areas in the state where residents do and do not have access to essential services, such as childcare, hospitals, grocery stores, libraries, and transit stops. This map shows a sample of what can be done using GIS and spatial analysis.

Geographic information systems allow us to ask big questions. As a community tool, GIS can empower residents and community leaders to make smarter decisions. With intergenerational poverty, the key is to provide residents with access to services that give them a fair opportunity to succeed. Planning for the success of future generations involves investing in these services now. As we move forward, GIS should be a required tool in the community toolbox.
