We are halfway through 2023 and things are slowing down some. Everybody dealing with flooding or the threat of, I guess. We did get the latest (July 1, 2022) population estimates for the towns and cities, that had been updated in the POPLASTESTIMATE field. 
Be sure to check out all the changes that have been made, and to make sure your boundaries are where they should be, view them on the [Utah Municipality Modifications map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63). All recent annexation documents can be viewed here: [Utah Lt. Governor Municipal Certifications](https://demosite.utah.gov/gov-entity/boundary-certifications-by-year/) website. This website is still in a transition phase so it may change in the future.
