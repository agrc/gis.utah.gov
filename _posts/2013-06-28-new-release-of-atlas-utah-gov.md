<p>AGRC recently released a new version of <a href="http://atlas.utah.gov/">atlas.utah.gov</a>, a map viewer that allows users to inspect the statewide base map services that highlight terrain, land ownership, aerial photography, etc.</p>
<p>Additionally, using the left-side navigation, users can experiment with several of the map-based web services from the <a href="http://api.mapserv.utah.gov/">api.mapserv.utah.gov</a> for address and place-finding.</p>
