We are at the halfway point in the year, or the beginning of the fiscal year, depending on how you look at it, and things in Utah are moving along. The United States Census Bureau has updated the 2018 population estimates, and AGRC has included the updates in Utah's municipal and county data. Municipality updates can be viewed on the [ArcGIS Utah Municipality Modifications page](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63). You can also check out the [AGRC State, County, and Municipal Boundaries page]({% link data/boundaries/citycountystate/index.html %}) to learn more about the City, County, and State Boundaries data layer.

As always, changes to town and city boundaries can affect other data layers, so if you are involved in municipal and county data, be sure to share your data with others. With the 2020 census coming up, AGRC is still pushing to get the State's data layers as perfect as we can, so we also encourage you to take a look at the State’s data and see whether we are missing anything, or if there is something strange, let us know.
