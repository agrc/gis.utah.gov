You can present hardcopy maps, interactive digital maps (you’ll need to provide a means to show it on a computer), or both.<br />
The focus of the event is interesting maps that are applicable to a wide variety of audiences.<br />
Maps can be of any topic.<br />
This event is not a product/services marketing opportunity, it’s purpose is to show elected officials the cool maps that people in Utah are making.</p>
