Earlier this month, the Census Bureau published the PL 94-171 Redistricting Data Summary data files from the 2020 Census. This is a prerelease of the 2020 census data with the data elements that pertain most to drawing new political district boundaries for congress, state house, and state senate districts.

The primary data elements included in the 4 tables that have been released are block-level population, voting age population, race/ethnicity identification, occupied and vacant housing unit counts, and group quarters populations.

Census expects to release this data in more user friendly formats in the coming month. And, sometime in the not so distant future (no announcement from Census yet) the full 2020 Census summary files will be released. These more detailed files were released starting in October of 2011 for the last census, but this decade's release has been 5-6 months behind schedule so far. So make your own guess and cross your fingers.

In the meantime, UGRC, with collaboration from the Analytics Group at WFRC, has created several GIS layers that hopefully make the 2020 redistricting data easier to use. The blocks files combines the primary information pieces from across the tables and employs more user friendly fieldnames (for shapefile users) and field aliasing for geodatabase users.
