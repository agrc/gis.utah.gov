<p>Maps on the Hill, supported by the Utah Geographic Information Council (UGIC) and AGRC, will be held on March 1, 2016. This event, in its fifth year, is a good opportunity for students and professionals to share maps, mapping tools, and mapping projects with elected officials, fellow practitioners, and the public.</p>

<p><strong>Maps on the Hill Event:</strong></em><br />
The map display event will be held during the 2016 Legislative session, in the Capitol Rotunda from 10:00 am – 1:00 pm, with set-up time beginning at 9:00am. We request that at least one participant is present to discuss each map entry throughout the display event.</p>
<p><strong><em>Display Types:</em></strong><br />
You can present hardcopy maps, interactive digital maps (you’ll need to provide a means to show it on a computer), or both.</p>
<p>The focus of the event is interesting maps or map technology projects that are applicable to a wide audience. While displays can be on any appropriate topic, presentations that may be of interest to decision makers are strongly encouraged. Marketing of specific product and services is discouraged.</p>
