<p>As a reminder, the GIS dataset depicting Utah Oil and Gas Wells is updated nightly on UGRC's ArcSDE (v.10) database server, via a database connection to the Division of Oil, Gas and Mining (DOGM).</p>
<p>The updated feature classes include Energy.DNROilGasWells, Energy.DNROilGasWells_HDBottom, and Energy.DNROilGasWells_HDPath. The latter two represent the bottom of the hole and 2D drilling path for horizontally drilled wells.</p>
<p>Also, the GIS dataset depicting Utah Oil and Gas Wells Unit polygons was updated today from data sent from DOGM. This data is updated periodically as needed.</p>
<p>A snapshot of the datasets mentioned above, together with Oil and Gas Field polygons was exported to shapefile and file geodatabase formats. These files are downloadable, via a browser,Â from the SGID ftp site using the second link below.</p>
