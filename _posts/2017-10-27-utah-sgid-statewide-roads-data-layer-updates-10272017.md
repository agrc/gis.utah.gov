Updates were recently made to the SGID10.Transportation.Roads and [SGID10.Transportation.RoadsODM]({% link _posts/2017-08-15-major-updates-coming-to-roads-data-model.md %}) feature classes that resides on the [Utah SGID ArcSDE database server]({% link sgid/open-sgid/index.md %}).

Updated roads data is also available as shapefiles and file geodatabase files for download on the [SGID Roads and Highway System download page]({% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}).

- The `DOT_RTID` field that stores UDOT's unique numeric route identifiers was updated

#### General Dataset Maintenance
- Implemented a more complete and standardized street (post) type domain for `POSTTYPE`, `A1_POSTTYPE`, and `A2_POSTTYPE` then ensured that all existing values in `POSTTYPE` conform to this new domain.
