In October a partnership of Utah organizations submitted a proposal to the [USGS 3DEP FY19/20 BAA](https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/3dep/fy1920-usgs-broad-agency-announcement-baa-3d-elevation-program-3dep) for over 18,217 square miles for 2020 Lidar acquisition projects. A couple projects (i.e., Kane County [Greater Sevier Addition] and Strawberry River) have already begun.

While we're months away from any preliminary or final funding decisions, the partnership is sharing [this proposed project area map]({{ "/images/3DEP_Lidar_Proposal_2020.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }})
 in advance in an effort to promote coordination between the partners and avoid duplication of effort in these project areas.

The proposed areas have the following square mileage:
