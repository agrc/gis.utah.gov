<p><img src="{{ "/images/UtahFireInfo.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" class="inline-text-right pull-right" /> AGRC, in partnership with the Governor's Office, the Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands, and the State Fire Marshal have released an interactive map of all fire restriction in the state of Utah.  Previously, this information was being maintained in several different locations across federal, state, and local entities.  With these willing partners and the critical nature of the information, a great level of cooperations helped to create a very timely and relevant resource for citizens of the state.</p>
