## About the 1,000 Miles Campaign

The 1,000 Miles Campaign is part of Governor Herbert's *Life Elevated 2020* plan and aims to "develop 1,000 miles of family-friendly trails and bike paths over the next 10 years in order to provide and promote active connections to school, work, and outdoor recreation in urban and rural communities throughout the state." Bike Utah is honored to be the nonprofit partner designated to carry out the implementation of the campaign. (Check out Governor Herbert's [campaign designation letter](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5b8b54d1f407b40494055e8f/t/5bdb2820cd8366e93792c238/1541089317373/1%2C000+Miles+Partnership+Letter.pdf) for more details.) As the official nonprofit partner, we are looking for shapefiles or maps with comprehensive descriptions, including your name; the project name, location, and estimated distance; and a short description of the type of infrastructure.

As soon as we verify the information you provide, we will put it all in this [google doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1QkSaARZNNcgHQZKaW2sVoCJ4cnSKIk4nVca29y_6l-w/edit#gid=0) where it will be
shared with the governor's office and the public. As the campaign progresses, a story map will also be created for displaying this data.

_Tracking progress of these projects is just one of our responsibilities._ **We can also provide strategic planning, technical assistance, and connections to financial resources**, so communities can begin or continue developing bicycling in their areas.

## So, what counts as "family friendly"?

- **Mountain bike and hiking trails.** Trails of various difficulties are allowed as long as signage is posted on each trail indicating the trail's level of difficulty.
- **Paved bike and multiuse trails.** Both on-street bike infrastructure and off-street paths can be counted as long as they fit into one of the three categories shown below:
