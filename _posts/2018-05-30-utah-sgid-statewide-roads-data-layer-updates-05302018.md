Updates were recently made to the SGID10.Transportation.Roads feature class that resides on the [Utah SGID ArcSDE database server]({% link sgid/open-sgid/index.md %}).

Updated roads data is also available as shapefiles and file geodatabase files for download on the [SGID Roads and Highway System download page]({% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}).

These updates are also reflected in [UGRC's address locators]({% link data/address-geocoders-locators/index.html %}) and the [Utah Next-Generation 911 GIS Database]({% link data/911/index.html %}).

#### UDOT Route System:

- The `DOT_F_MILE` (From Milepost) and `DOT_T_MILE` (To Milepost) fields that store the milepost attributes of the UDOT state and federal routes in SGID10.Transportation.Roads were updated.
- The following SGID feature classes were also updated: SGID10.Transportation.UDOTMileposts; SGID10.Transportation.UDOTRoutes_LRS; and SGID10.Transportation.UDOTTenthMileRefPoints.

#### General Update Notes for this Month:
- Vertical Level field (`VERT_LEVEL`) attributes were assigned on non-highway roads based on semi-automated process of finding segments that had significant intersect, which were then visually inspected to assign vertical level.  All other segments were assigned ground level, for now.  Work is currently being done to look at highways and other suspect areas.
- Significant work was done to orient Interstate arc directions based on mileposts (arcs were oriented based address systems if address ranges were present - ie: Utah County, etc). One way attributes were also updated to reflect these changes.
- The DOT Left and Right ownership fields (`DOT_OWN_L` and `DOT_OWN_R`) were appropriately populated and a domain was added for future maintenance.
