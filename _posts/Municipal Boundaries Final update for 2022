It's the end of another long year and, ready or not, 2023 is here. Another year of growth for the state which has slowed down some. Top contributors are Utah and Cache County once again with 23 annexations in Utah Co., and another 16 in Cache Co.. Five other counties follow with 5 to 7 annexations this year. There is a tie for the biggest growing city, both had six annexations: Utah County’s Lehi and Sevier County’s Richfield. The State’s total for the year is 90 annexations; 84 annexations, 3 disconnections, 2 adjustments, and one incorporation. This is similar to the last couple of years. 
The latest incorporation is in Tooele County again this year. Everyone welcome the city of Erda. That makes the total number of cities in Utah now at 249 and 5 Metro Townships. Something for your next Trivia round.

We would like to thank all the hardworking recorders and staff out there in the counties and towns. With your help, the Lieutenant Governor’s Office and UGRC processes all annexations, adjustments, disconnections, and incorporations for the state.

Our annual submission to the US Census Bureau Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS) program will be done next month. All the updates from 2022 will be submitted. Boundary updates submitted will also be reflected in the American Community Survey (ACS) and Population Estimates Program (PEP) data estimates and in next year’s BAS materials.

As always feel free to check out all the changes and make sure your boundaries are where you think they should be, view them here: [Utah Municipality Modifications map].

This is a website in transition so it may change in the future.
