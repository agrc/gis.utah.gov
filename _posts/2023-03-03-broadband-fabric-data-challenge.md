_From the I Challenge You to a Duel department_
{: .text-center}

Among the many lessons the Covid-19 pandemic taught us, we learned two things about high-speed internet. First, high upload _and_ download speeds are necessary in the modern world. Second, figuring out what high-speed internet was available in our neighborhood is a more difficult task than it should be.

Unfortunately, this second problem isn't new—the state and federal governments have been struggling with poor data on broadband availability for years. While the FCC required providers to report coverage, the reliance on census block geometries made it nigh impossible to get an accurate and fine-grained picture. Without accurate data, governments have struggled to direct resources and policy to areas that are lacking coverage or the competition necessary for free market economics to do their thing. Ultimately, consumers have often been the ones to suffer slow speeds and high prices.

There's a bright light on the horizon. In 2019, the FCC [voted](https://www.fcc.gov/document/fcc-improves-broadband-mapping) to collect more granular data and hopefully improve some of the [long-standing problems](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2019/08/the-fccs-horrible-broadband-mapping-system-is-finally-getting-an-upgrade/) with the existing system. As part of these efforts, the FCC invited state and local governments to submit corrections to the Broadband Data Collection process to take advantage of their local local knowledge.

UGRC, working with the [Utah Broadband Center](https://business.utah.gov/broadband/), collaborated with county GIS departments to respond to this invitation. **This cooperation and collaboration resulted in Utah having, by far, the largest number of corrections accepted in the nation.** This would not have been possible without the hard work (on a tight deadline) of the counties who were able to participate. This timely participation will help ensure Utah gets its fair share of the $42.45 billion dollar Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment funding distributed by the federal government.

We express a heart-felt **Thank You!** to Box Elder, Weber, Tooele, Salt Lake, Utah, Summit, and Wayne counties for participating on such short notice. With their help we were able to gather over 110,000 challenges, with over 48,000 ultimately being accepted: **24,598 new locations and 23,491 corrected addresses.**

## The Collection Process: Every Program Needs Acronyms
{: .flex .flex--left}

The work behind the FCC's new [broadband map](https://broadbandmap.fcc.gov/home) has been christened the [Broadband Data Collection](https://www.fcc.gov/BroadbandData), or BDC for short. There are two critical pieces to the BDC: a foundation of location data called the "fabric" made up of Broadband Serviceable Locations (BSLs) and the actual availability data that is built on top of the BSLs.

While the map will support decision making for years to come, there's also a more immediate need. The National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA) will be making its state-level allocations of the $42.45 billion [Broadband Equity, Access, and Deployment (BEAD) program](https://broadbandusa.ntia.doc.gov/taxonomy/term/158/broadband-equity-access-and-deployment-bead-program) based on the data in the map.

### Yards and Yards of Fabric
{: .flex .flex--left}

The fabric is the [basis of the BDC](https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/5375384069659-What-is-the-Location-Fabric-), the foundation that everything elses is built upon. It is "a dataset of all locations ... where fixed broadband internet access service is or could be installed." These Broadband Serviceable Locations are meant to capture every single structure in the country that should be part of the broadband conversation.

The FCC tackled the daunting challenge of identifying every single broadband serviceable structure in the country by hiring a third party contractor, CostQuest, to develop an initial fabric. CostQuest used [aerial imagery-based machine learning combined with publicly available parcel, address, and other datasets](https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/9157937493275-Video-Broadband-Serviceable-Location-Fabric-How-It-Was-Created) to identify BSLs. The first version of the fabric was released in June of 2022, and updated versions are being released every six months.

### Challenge Accepted...?
{: .flex .flex--left}

As part of the update process, the FCC allows governments, providers, and individuals to suggest improvements to the fabric, what they call a [challenge](https://help.bdc.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/8554187214107-Fabric-Challenge-Process). These corrections can be missing BSLs, incorrect addresses, wrong locations, that sort of thing.

Fabric challenges have to follow a very specific format and must reach a certain level of evidence and defensibility before CostQuest will add them to the fabric. While they give local governments a large amount of deference for local knowledge, they still perform checks on the challenge submissions before accepting them as BSLs.

The Utah Broadband Center worked with UGRC to prepare a state-wide fabric challenge on behalf of the cities and counties throughout the state. This created a buffer between the bureaucratic requirements of the FCC submission and the local experts at the county level, allowing them to spend their limited time on the work that really matters.

### Time's A-Ticking
{: .flex .flex--left}

While the fabric will be updated twice a year in the future, this first challenge was vital for the BEAD distribution process. In early September 2022, NTIA announced they would use the second version of the fabric as the basis for BEAD allocation in order to give states the opportunity to submit a challenge to the "first draft" version of the fabric. Then the FCC clarified that they would incorporate any challenges submitted by November 1st into the second version of the fabric.

This seven-week week window was the biggest hurdle in the challenge process. The Utah Broadband Center sent an invitation to both the counties and the tribal governments to participate in this last-minute effort. The invite included our brief analysis of the fabric compared against our statewide address points along with some template datasets and instructions to help them prepare their challenges.

### Crushing the Challenge with Collaboration
{: .flex .flex--left}

We are thrilled at the responses we received from the counties despite the short notice. The counties that were able to participate reallocated their limited resources to provide more challenges, and more accepted challenges, than any other state in the nation.

Collaboration is the hallmark of the GIS community in Utah—it created and maintains the SGID, one of the premier state-level geospatial resources. And, with this project, collaboration has helped ensure Utahns' homes are counted when it comes to broadband.
