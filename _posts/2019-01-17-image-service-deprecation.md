The AGRC brownout of the mapserv image services on mapserv.utah.gov from January 5 through 10, 2019, in preparation for the ArcGIS Server upgrade was very successful. We want to thank you for your participation and apologize for any inconvenience that the brownout may have caused. The few people that were negatively affected and were caught by surprise are now informed about the deprecation of image services and are on the migration path forward. You may reference the [original post]({% link _posts/2018-12-05-arc-gis-server-10-6-upgrade.md %}) for instructions on how to prepare for the deprecation.

With the brownout behind us, AGRC has chosen the date of **Thursday, February 14**, to permanently remove the image services. The deprecation Utah Change Management System reference number is `CHG0019495` and will be discussed at the next two change management meetings.

We hope this deprecation does not surprise anyone. {{ contact }} know so we can so we can make other arrangements as soon as possible.
