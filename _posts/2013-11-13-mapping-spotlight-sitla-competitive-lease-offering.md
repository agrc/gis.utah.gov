<p><a href="{{ "/downloads/SITLALeases-246x300.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img src="{{ "/images/SITLALeases-246x300.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" style="margin-right:30px" width="208" height="250" align="left" /></a> The State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) has made a map that displays current and historic Competitive Lease Offering Units and Results for Oil, Gas and Associated Hydrocarbons and Other Mineral Commodities. The map makes it easy to visually see the location of the units being offered on a current Competitive Offering, as well as the results.  The map is updated each time a Competitive Offering is held.</p>
<p>SITLA manages approximately 3.5 million acres of surface ownership and approximately 4.5 million acres of mineral ownership. Out of the 146 units offered during the October 2013 Competitive Lease Offering, 86 were approved for leasing.  This includes Oil and Gas, Tar Sands, Phosphate and Industrial Sands leases. </p>
