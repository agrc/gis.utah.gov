<p>The site, <a href="https://utahdnr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/MapTour/index.html?appid=e9f627369824484bab5a6399a5149c9a&webmap=5b3cff7c878642b99971a7a10491a04a">Utah's Mining Heritage and Tourism Virtual Tour</a>, uses a 'story map' template to connect symbols on the map to narrative and photos -- highlighting the landforms, landmarks, and history of mining in Utah. The user interface is engaging and intuitive and should work well for general audiences including tourism and education. Nice Work! </p>
