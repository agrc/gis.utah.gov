The interactive map gallery provides easy navigation and a static location for finding newly created maps.  </p>
<p>The maps in the gallery range from a basic water resources reference map to a map of the Fremont River and it's local reservoirs and diversions. The maps can be used to reference anything related to water resources, such as water-related land use, tracking DWRe's projects, and drought conditions/water supply. </p>
