An update was recently made to `SGID10.LOCATION.AddressSystemQuadrants`. The purpose of the update was to add address system quadrants to Wasatch County that had been provided to AGRC by Wasatch County GIS.

<figure class="caption caption--left"><a href="{{ "/downloads/Grids.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}"><img class="caption__image" title="Address System Quadrants" src="{{ "/images/Grids.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="" width="276" height="300" /></a><figcaption class="caption__text">Address System Quadrants</figcaption></figure>

There are four grids in Wasatch County --- Heber, Midway, Strawberry, and Wallsburg. Wasatch County also is partially covered by the Kamas.
