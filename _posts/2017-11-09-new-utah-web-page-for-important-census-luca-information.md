If you manage city or county address data in GIS or other formats, AGRC has a [new web page]({% link data/address/census-luca-2020.md %}) with Utah-specific information about the Census Bureau's Local Update of Census Address program.

The LUCA program is the pipeline to supply Census with best, most up-to-date address data, to best position Utah for the 2020 census, and a rightful share from census-informed federal funding formulas that support programs ranging from roads and highways to school lunch programs.

[The new page]({% link data/address/census-luca-2020.md %}) includes information describing the LUCA program and its schedule. Additionally it serves as a gateway to supporting GIS data, advice on LUCA strategy and prioritization, and resources from the November 2 LUCA training held in Salt Lake City.
