Finally 2020 is behind us. Despite the year's challenges, the hardworking folks in the Lieutenant Governor's Office and all those working in the city and county recorders offices didn’t slow down. Utah County once again led the way with 30 annexations, and Cache County was next at 13. Nine other counties followed with 4 to 6 annexations throughout the year, bringing the grand total to 98 annexations in 2020, which is not bad, all things considered.

The folks out in Erda, in Tooele County, voted to incorporate, so we will be adding them in next year. Unfortunately we lost the Town of Cedar Heights, down in Iron County, this year. 

As always, feel free to check out all the municipal boundaries changes and make sure your boundaries are where you think they should be. You can view them on the [Utah Municipality Modifications page](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63).
To review any specific annexation document, go to the [Utah Lt. Governor Municipal Certifications page](https://municert.utah.gov/).
