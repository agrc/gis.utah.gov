AGRC had a great time at the 2015 Utah Geographic Information Council (UGIC) Conference at Snowbird. The pre-conference training, plenary speeches, and break out sessions were all great and informative. A highlight at the AGRC booth was the "Where in Utah Quiz?". If you didn't get a chance to complete the quiz at UGIC, the quiz is available at right. Feel free to download and distribute as you see fit.
