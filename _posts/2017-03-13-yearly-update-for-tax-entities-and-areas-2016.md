We have finished the updates for the Utah State Tax Entities and Areas for 2016!
The new new data is available online from the [Sales Tax Areas and Tax Entities Areas]({% link data/economy/taxingareas/index.html %}) data page.

The **Transit Special Tax Areas** were adjusted in the **Cache Transit area**. These adjustment were done to _exclude_ areas incorporated into the cities that surrounded the entity.
