categories: []
---
The 2015 Utah Legislative General Session passed Senate Bill 264, which established the Monument Replacement and Restoration Committee (MRRC), as well as funding to establish a County grant program to preserve public land survey monuments (<a href="http://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title63F/Chapter1/63F-1-S510.html">UCA 63F-1-510</a>). The committee <a href="http://gis.utah.gov/big-happenings-with-public-land-survey-system-gis/">began meeting in September</a>, and is now accepting grant applications to restore survey monuments until <strong>February 16, 2016</strong>.

A county wishing to submit an application to the Committee that meets the following requirements:

- Identifies one or more monuments in the county that are in need of protection or rehabilitation.
- Establishes a plan that is consistent with federal law or rule to protect or rehabilitate each monument.
- Requests a specific amount of funding to complete the plan.

Supporting documents, including the grant application, are available <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=0BxZfA5vHEKqzUGozazR5bFNPRU0">here</a>.
