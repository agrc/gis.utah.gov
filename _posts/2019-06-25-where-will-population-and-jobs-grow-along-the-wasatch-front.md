Seven new GIS datasets are now available that provide annual projections, through 2050, of population and job densities for the Salt Lake - Provo - Ogden urban corridor extending from Santaquin north to Brigham City. The projections datasets each present the annual forecasted counts for each year 2019 through 2050 for the following variables:

- Population (excluding group quarters)
- Household Count (excluding group quarters)
- Total Jobs
- Industrial Jobs
- Office Jobs
- Retail Jobs
- Typical Jobs (a subtotal of jobs with typical travel & commuting patterns (sums Industrial, Office, & Retail Jobs)
- Nontypical Jobs (with non typical travel demand, sums agriculture, constructions, & mining jobs)

Actually there are [14 datasets](https://data.wfrc.org/search?q=projections), as this data is available at two geographic levels:

  1. “City Areas” aggregations that closely reflect current city boundaries, and
  1. Traffic Analysis Zone polygons, which are much smaller.

The projections datasets were created using the Real Estate Market Model (REMM), an UrbanSim-based model developed by WFRC and MAG to support transportation and land use planning. To arrive at its predictions for our future, REMM relies upon a developer profitability module and input data, including: detailed county tax parcel GIS layers, transportation plans, envisioned land uses, and county-level projections from the U of U’s Gardner Policy Institute (control totals).
