Updates were made recently to the SGID10.BOUNDARIES.Municipalities feature class that resides on the Utah SGID ArcSDE database server.

The AGRC basemaps have been updated to reflect these changes.

The following highlights what has been updated:

Municipalities Updates:

- **Salt Lake County:** Annexation for Sandy City, Disconnection for Cottonwood Heights
- **Uintah County:** Some major annexations were missing and adjustments to match current PLSS/GCDB Township and Section lines were made to Ballard, Naples, and Vernal. Thanks to Jordan Merrel for the data.
- **Utah County:** Annexation for Eagle Mountain
