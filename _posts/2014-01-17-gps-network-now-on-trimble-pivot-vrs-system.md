<p>Once you have a current paid account follow these 3 step to get connected to the new system:</p>
<p>Step 1<br />
In your internet browser type in the address bar 168.179.231.9 which brings up the Trimble Pivot web page. </p>
<p>Step 2<br />
Select Register (found on the left side) and fill in your Personal Data. Be sure to use a unique email for each account, and don't enter anything for GSM Phone Number for TNC.<br />
Select Next at the bottom of the page.</p>
<p>Step 3<br />
