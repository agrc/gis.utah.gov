### Coordinate System and Datum
{: .text-left}

The native coordinate system for the Discover services is Web Mercator with a WGS 1984 datum (EPSG 3857). Many users work in coordinate systems with a different datum (for example, EPSG 3566: Utah Central with NAD 1983). Users who need the highest locational precision must use the appropriate [geographic transformation conversion]({% link images/Transformation.png %}) to remedy the roughly one meter difference between the WGS84 and NAD83 datums' “realization points.” UGRC uses the `NAD_1983_To_WGS_1984_5` transformation when creating base map tiles and web applications, but **there may be more accurate transformations based on the data and area you are working with**. The default (no transformation specified) will likely introduce several feet of horizontal positional error. More information about these transformations can be found on ESRI's [NAD 1983 To WGS 1984](https://support.esri.com/en/knowledgebase/techarticles/detail/24159) How-To.

ArcGIS Pro seems to load an appropriate transformation, but you may need to set the transformation in ArcMap or other software.

### Horizontal Positional Accuracy
{: .text-left}

Stated horizontal accuracy of the `Google` imagery is expected to achieve or exceed one meter (CE90) in most areas without significant vertical relief. You can generally expect higher precision in urban areas where existing supplemental ground control was more abundant.

The `Hexagon` imagery have a stated horizontal accuracies of 1.07 and 2.6 meters (CE90), respectively.

The pre-2018 `NAIP` layers have a stated horizontal positional accuracy of 5 meters, while the `2018 and post-2018 NAIP` products have a horizontal positional accuracy of 4 meters.

### Google Archive Services
{: .text-left}

<p markdown="span">
{% include fa_icon.html lock=true class="svg-inline--fa fa-w-14 fa-fw" %} In addition to the statewide `Google` imagery service layer, there are archive layers available (ex. `Google 2011archive`) of the Google imagery organized by year collected.
</p>

### Licensed Imagery Flight Dates
{: .text-left}

<p markdown="span">
{% include fa_icon.html lock=true class="svg-inline--fa fa-w-14 fa-fw" %} The flight dates of each Hexagon imagery flight line are in the `opensgid.indices.hexagon_service_dates` SGID layer. This layer is also available on our [Open Data site](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah-hexagon-service-dates), where you can get a link to the web service or download it in the format of your choice.
</p>

<p markdown="span">
{% include fa_icon.html lock=true class="svg-inline--fa fa-w-14 fa-fw" %} Similarly, the dates of the 'Google' imagery service layer are stored in the `opensgid.indices.google_service_dates` SGID layer available on our [Open Data site](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/datasets/utah-google-service-dates).

### Pro/ArcMap User Considerations
{: .text-left}

{%capture contact2 %}{% include contact.html subject=page.title contact=site.data.contacts.discover text='please contact' %}{% endcapture %}

Legacy username/password users: If you have not yet received quad-word links to the service (ex. `https://discover.agrc.utah.gov/login/path/your-unique-quad-word/`) that do not require a username and password, {{ contact2 }}

Users experiencing problems with the service, such as blurry tiles or different year vintages at different scales, may need to clear their local cache:

- **ArcMap** Go to the service’s `Layer Properties -> Cache` tab and selecting `Clear Local Cache Now`. Be patient as this could take several minutes. If the blurry tiles persist you have the options to `Clear cache when the session ends` or `Don't cache any data locally`. Another option is to completely clear your ArcMap cache by going to `Customize -> ArcMap Options -> Display Cache -> Clear Cache`.

- **ArcGIS Pro** Go to the service’s `Layer Properties -> Cache` tab and selecting `Clear Cache`. You can also clear your entire Pro cache by going to the Pro project's `Options -> Display` and check `Clear cache` and selecting `OK`.

**ArcMap 10 and 10.1 users** should use WMS instead of WMTS. ArcMap 10 and below do not support WMTS, and ArcMap 10.1 [has issues](https://community.esri.com/thread/58788) rendering WMTS data.

### Usage Tracking

### Layers Not Exporting When Using WMS
{: .text-left}

If you are using a WMS connection, you may find that the Discover layer does not show up when you export or print your map. This is due to a technical limitation of the WMS protocol. The only fixes are to use WMTS, export at a lower resolution, or use a local copy (for aerial imagery).

**Background**

In WMS, the client (ArcMap, a browser, etc) requests a map of a specific extent and resolution. The server creates a single image matching the request and returns it to the client—a 8.5" x 11" image at 100 dpi would be 850 x 1,100 pixels (just shy of one megapixel). Every time the user pans or zooms, the server creates and sends a completely new image, which consumes server processing power and bandwidth. To maintain performance for all users, WMS servers will not create and return an image if its dimensions exceed a certain size.

Applications like ArcMap and web browsers have a relatively small window and use a resolution of 96 dpi, resulting in requests that fit within the server's allowed size. However, exporting a 20" x 30" map at 300 dpi results in a 6,000 x 9,000 pixel (54 megapixel) image. This far exceeds the server's limit, so it does not return an image. ArcMap dutifully finishes exporting the map instead of raising an error, resulting in a map without the layer. You can try changing the Output Image Quality (Resample Ratio) setting to reduce the requested resolution, but the output quality will suffer.

In contrast, WMTS works by delivering a set of fixed-dimension tiles at the requested zoom level that cover the requested extent. Because the tiles are pre-rendered, all the server has to do is figure out which tiles to send and then send them—and this is sped up by the client caching previously received tiles and only requesting ones it hasn't seen yet. This allows WMTS to quickly serve up tiles for much larger and/or more detailed maps than WMS without clogging the server.

### Small Text/Symbology in QGIS
{: .text-left}

When using the basemap services in QGIS, you may experience small text and symbology when using bilinear or cubic resampling at scales other than the normal [web map scales](https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/mapping/web-map-zoom-levels-updated/). The resampling settings are defined in `Layer Properties > Symbology > Resampling`. Using bilinear or cubic resampling can look much better than the default nearest neighbor method.

This behavior is controlled by the "oversampling" value. At values greater than `1.00`, the text/symbology can appear smaller (QGIS is sending a "zoomed out" WMTS request and sampling it down to your desired scale). At values less than `1.00`, text/symbology can appear larger (it sends a "zoomed in" request and samples it up). QGIS uses the resampling method selected in the "in" dropdown at values less than `1.00`, and the "out" method at values greater than `1.00`.

### Other Tidbits
{: .text-left}

- We suggest that you occasionally refresh the connection to the imagery services by right-clicking your service connection in ArcCatalog or ArcMap's Catalog Viewer and selecting the `Refresh` button to see the latest list of available services.
- Since the Google acquisition flight blocks are not done all at once (as opposed to the NAIP products, which cover the whole state for every acquisition), there will be distinct color and positional changes at flight block boundaries. For large area maps, the color-balanced NAIP may be a more aesthetically pleasing cartographic choice.
- UGRC has downloaded a statewide master set of the image files for redistribution, as the download process directly from the Google Cloud Platform incurs transactional costs for cloud server & bandwidth usage.
- UGRC has a [feedback reporting form](https://docs.google.com/a/utah.gov/forms/d/1UGU77SPM_HX0r8zblIs05C-H5mLyRja1gRT7Fu4aKZk/viewform?fbzx=-6743712545663240221) for imagery users around the state to report imagery and service issues so they can be passed along to the imagery producers. Please submit your feedback through this form.
