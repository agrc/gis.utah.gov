<dd>

This data set consists of 0.3-meter pixel resolution (approximately 1-foot), natural color orthoimages covering the urban area footprint.  An orthoimage is remotely sensed image data in which displacement of features in the image caused by terrain relief and sensor orientation have been mathematically removed. Orthoimagery combines the image characteristics of a photograph with the geometric qualities of a map.  The design accuracy is estimated not to exceed 3-meter diagonal RMSE (2.12m RMSE in X or Y). Originally each orthoimage provided imagery over a 1500- by 1500-meter block on the ground. As a result of mosaicing these blocks into larger tiles, the block on the ground is closer to a 4500- by 4500-meter block on average. There is no image overlap between adjacent files. The projected coordinate system is UTM with a NAD83 datum. The naming convention is based on the U.S. National Grid (USNG) and uses the coordinates of the SW corner of the orthoimage.

<dt><em>Purpose:</em>  
<dd>

This data depicts geographic features on the surface of the earth.  It was created to provide easily accessible geospatial data which is readily available to enhance the capability of Federal, State, and local emergency responders, as well as plan for homeland security efforts.  This data also supports The National Map.

Radiometry is verified by visual inspection of the digital orthophoto.  Slight systematic radiometric differences may exist between adjacent orthoimage files; these are due primarily to differences in source image capture dates and sun angles along flight lines.  These differences can be observed in an image's general lightness or darkness when it is compared to adjacent orthoimage file coverages. Tonal balancing may be performed over a group of images during the mosaicking process which may serve to lighten or darken adjacent images for better color tone matching.

All GeoTIFF tagged image files are validated using Z/I software to ensure the correct physical format and field values. All imagery is viewed using Z/I's IRASC to insure proper loading before being archived. All seamlines and tile edges are visually inspected. This check ensures balanced radiometry, no VOID areas, and seamline matches to within one meter. Once all imagery has been subjected to this quality check, we again review 10 percent of all final tiles independently for the same issues to guard against missed quality control.

</dd>
<dt><em>Completeness_Report:</em>  
<dd>

Orthoimages are visually inspected for completeness to ensure that no gaps or image misplacements exist within and between adjacent tiles. All image tiles at the extremities of the project are checked to ensure there are no VOID areas, and that the entire project area is completely covered by orthorectified imagery. Source imagery is cloud free.

<dd>

The horizontal accuracy of the orthrectified imagery is primarily determined by the quality of the Aerial
Triangulation solution and the surface model (DEM).
All ground targets were visible with .2 meter x 3.6 meter targets, and measured with GPS.
The AT procedure takes the raw bands (BW,FW and N) and rectifies them to a plane using the GPS data that was collected simultaneously with the imagery.  This was accomplished using the Leica Gpro software.   Automatic Point Measurement (APM) was used to place terrain points on each panchromatic L1 image.  The panchromatic L1's along with the each of the colour L0's were then imported into ORIMA so that an AT adjustment could be executed.  At this stage each individual strip of imagery was not tied to the neighbouring strips.  Several iterations were run until all bad points were eliminated.  The points were then exported to an x,y,z text file so that a DEM could be created, allowing APM a surface file so that it could more accurately calculate the tie points.  Once the second APM process was complete, the strips were tied together, and several adjustments were run, removing the points with high residuals until a suitable sigma value was reached.  Control was then measured and a final adjustment  calculated.  Standard deviations and residual were reviewed to verify that it was a good solution.  The support files were then updated with the new orientation information.  The L1 RGB bands were then rectified using the updated orientation information.
Specifically for SLC, cross-strips running E-W were used in the AT solution to give strength to the block being worked.  Between blocks, there was a common cross strip used in the AT giving overall strength to the solution.  
The Data Capture stage was accomplished by ingesting the Orima AT solution into the ISPM Z/I software. Using an Z/I SSK workstation and ISSD software for viewing, The surface data was collected with in-house VMS data cature software supplimenting a USGS surface with DEM points and breaklines.  
The rectification stage involved rectifying the 16 bit per channel imagery using Z/I's ISBR software. We then rectified the L1 data into manageable pieces with overlapping imagery between the strips, converted the imagery to 8 bits per channel. The radiometry was then adjusted, the rectified imagery was run through our in-house AIM software for automated seamline generation. These seamlines were then checked, and once manually verified, the final ortho tiles were generated. At the QC stage any building or
above ground feature obscuring a transportation feature is corrected. All orthophoto tiles were checked visually for relative horizontal accuracy in reference to adjacent tiles. Orthophoto measurements were taken from the 6 horizontal ground control points in the project area. An RMSE was calculated for the XY error residuals of the positional differences between the surveyed values and the values measured from the rectified imagery.
<P>
Once received by the AGRC the images were mosaiced into groups that on average are 9 of the original GeoTIFF images.The process used to mosaic the images was to turn the images in multi-stack grids, mosaic the grids for each individual band in GRID, make a stack of the merged bands, and turn the new grid stack back into an image.
