<h3>Why</h3>
<p>The parcel shapefile and file geodatabase data that UGRC standardizes are the most popular vector downloads on this
  website. The parcel viewer makes this data accessible to anyone with a web browser. In turn, it is one of the most
  popular web applications that UGRC offers. Not every county has their own parcel viewing application, so this
  application fills in the gaps. When a county does have their own web application, the parcel viewer displays a link to
  it.</p>
<h3>Data Origination</h3>
<p>The Recorders Office at the county level creates and maintains parcel data. The counties share the parcel data with
  UGRC on a schedule. UGRC standardizes the data into a common schema across all 29 counties.</p>
<h3>Challenges</h3>
<p>Utah contains 29 counties that uniquely handle parcel data. In order to create a statewide data set UGRC <acronym
    title="Extract, transfer, load">ETL</acronym>'s the county data into a common schema with common fields. After the
  29 county data layers are standardized, the developers were able to use <a
    href="https://github.com/agrc/forklift">forklift</a> to optimize the data even further for use in the application.
</p>
<p>Since there are 29 different parcel layers for Utah and the application is displaying information across all of the
  counties, it would be very inefficient to put all 29 layers in a map and query each layer on every user click. Another
  option would be to query the county layer first to figure out which county the click was in and then choose the
  correct parcel layer, but that is also inefficient. Using forklift, the developers were able to create one layer
  containing statewide parcels. The fields that are not displayed in the web application were removed and indexes were
  added to the fields that are searched on. This creates an optimal experience for the users with very fast query
  capability over the entire state.</p>
