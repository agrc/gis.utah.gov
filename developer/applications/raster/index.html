<h3>Why</h3>
<p>Aerial photography, digital elevation models, LiDAR, topographic maps and elevation contours are invaluable asset for
  GIS and other industries. Knowing what resources are available for a location is a must. UGRC continues to organize
  the purchase of new LiDAR, elevation models and imagery while keeping the historical products available as services or
  as a download.</p>
<p>Individually handling every unique public request for data does not scale and basic ftp downloads do not provide an
  acceptable user experience by UGRC standards. The Raster Data Discovery application is updated when new products are
  available making it the one stop web application for discovering and downloading the information you need.</p>
<h3>Data Challenges</h3>
<p>The sheer volume of data for this application presented a challenge. There are many dozens of layers and associated
  services. This was made manageable by creating extent polygons for each product. These are managed in polygon feature
  classes; one for each raster product category. This allows us to not have to query the tile indices for the actual
  products until a specific product is chosen.</p>
