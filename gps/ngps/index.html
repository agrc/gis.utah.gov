<h2 class="text-left">What is a Reference Network</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://arcg.is/0SG5ra0">GPS Network</a> 
  is a high precision Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)
  providing real time corrections and data for post processing. A GNSS network consists of permanently located GPS
  receivers, installed across the state, that generate real time high accuracy GPS positioning. Basically, all of the
  permanently installed GPS receivers send their data to a system that analyzes the input and adjusts and corrects the
  data to provide the most accurate locations.</p>

<h2 class="text-left">{% include fa_icon.html information=true class="svg-inline--fa fa-w-16 fa-fw" %} About this
  Network</h2>
<p>The Nevada GPS Network (formerly Washoe County GPS Network) is now being managed by the State of Utah. The Nevada GPS
  Network provides users with real time corrections and data for post processing.
  The Coordinate Reference Frame for this network is <strong>NAD83/94 (HARN)</strong>. The Latitude, Longitude and
  Ellipsoidal Height of each reference station was calculated by processing 24 hour files using the National Geodetic
  Survey (NGS) Online Positioning User Service (OPUS) Projects application.</p>
<p>With an activated subscription, set your GPS unit's VRS connection address to <code>168.179.231.11</code> and port
  <code>2102</code>. Enter your new device-specific username and password.
</p>
<h5>Connections from Source Table</h5>
<p>For Trimble units we have three different connections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>VRS_CMR works older Trimble unit
  <li>VRS_CMRp works with Trimble units that are newer but may not have the latest updates to the firmware.
  <li>VRS_CMRx works with the newest up to date Trimble units
</ul>
<p>All of these give you the network solution.</p>
<p>For non-Trimble units we have two different connections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>VRS_RTCM23 works older non-Trimble unit
  <li>VRS_RTCM31 works with non-Trimble units
  <li>VRS_RTCM3.2 works with non-Trimble units, gives a full GNSS solution (all available satellites)
</ul>
<p>Both of these give you the network solution.</p>
<p>MS_CMR, MS_CMRP, MS_RTCM3.2 these are for connecting to single base when you are on the edge of the network or not
  getting a strong network solution. System will automatically find the closest station and connect you.</p>

<h5>Rinex File Downloads</h5>
<p>The Nevada GPS network is providing 24 hour Rinex files with 5 second epoch available for download here:
  <a href="http://nevadagps.utah.gov/4ngs ">Nevada GPS Rinex Download</a>
  Due to storage limits, files can only be stored for a 90 day period, than they are permanently deleted.

<h2 class="text-left">Getting Started</h2>
<div class="flex flex--row flex--wrap">
  <h3 class="text-left">Create a New, or Renew an Existing, Subscription for <a href="http://nevadagps.utah.gov">Nevada
      GPS</a></h3>
  <p>To create a new subscription or renew an existing subscription for Nevada GPS, you’ll need to provide the following
    information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>the name of your organization (avoid punctuation);
    <li>a login/username;
    <li>a password (8 characters);
    <li>a contact name, email address (once you add in your email address, it will be associated/connected with your
      account and can't be used again), and phone number;
    <li>your physical location/address; and
    <li>your mailing address.
  </ul>
  <p>To pay for your subscription, visit turngps.utah.gov to access the online payment system. The cost is $600 and
    gives you access to TURN GPS Network also. You’ll need a credit card to process your payment.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Select “Register” on the navigation pane on the left-hand side of the page.
    <li>Click the “New Registration” button. (Note: Both new subscriptions and renewed subscriptions for Nevada GPS are
      considered “new” to the TURN system.)
    <li>Review the Terms and Conditions, and then click “I agree” to continue.
    <li>Fill out all the required fields, including the name of your organization, your login/username, a password for
      your TURN GPS account, and your personal contact information.
    <li>Click “Register” to create your account.
  </ul>
  <p>At this point, the system will direct you to the payment page. Make sure that you have your payment information
    readily available, as the system will automatically time out after a while, requiring you to start over with a whole
    new login/username, password, and email. If the system keeps coming back with the password field empty, the system
    may think that your email is already in use and, therefore, will not allow you to move forward. Each subscription
    needs a unique email address (even if it is a made-up one [e.g., gps_login@BobsBigBurger.com]).</p>
  <p>After you have created/renewed and paid for your subscription, you will receive an email with a receipt. It
    typically takes the system about 24 hours to process a payment and activate an account for fieldwork using the TURN
    GPS Network. {% include contact.html subject='VRS Network Creation/Renewal' contact=site.data.contacts.turn
    text='Accordingly, to avoid a disruption or delay in service please email' hide-punctuation=true %} with your
    organization, login/username, and password. We will manually renew or create your subscription in the Nevada GPS
    network and push your subscription through the system as soon as possible. Once your account is successfully
    activated, you will receive another email confirming your subscription.</p>
