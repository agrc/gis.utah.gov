<h2 class="text-left">What Is a Reference Network?</h2>
<p>A <a href="https://utah.maps.arcgis.com/apps/instant/minimalist/index.html?appid=95e0d153d1ce4ba39556c9f94284c68c">GPS Network</a> 
  is a high-precision global navigation satellite system (GNSS)
  providing real-time corrections and data for post processing. A <abbr
    title="global navigation satellite system">GNSS</abbr> network consists of permanently located GPS receivers,
  installed across the state, that generate real-time, high-accuracy GPS positioning. Basically, all of the permanently
  installed GPS receivers send their data to a system that analyzes the input and adjusts and corrects the data to
  provide the most accurate locations.</p>

<h2 class="text-left">{% include fa_icon.html information=true class="svg-inline--fa fa-w-16 fa-fw" %} About this
  Network</h2>
<p>The coordinate reference frame for this network is <strong>NAD83(2011)(EPOCH:2010.0000.)</strong>. The latitude,
  longitude, and ellipsoidal height of each reference station were calculated by processing 24 hour files using the
  National Geodetic Survey (NGS) Online Positioning User Service (OPUS) Projects application.</p>
<p>Eighteen <abbr title="National Geodetic Survey">NGS</abbr> Continually Operating Reference Stations (CORS) were
  selected along the perimeter and interior of the network and were constrained to the published coordinates to conduct
  the final adjustment of the network coordinates.</p>
<p>With an activated subscription, set your GPS unit's VRS connection address to <code>168.179.231.9</code> and port
  <code>2101</code>. Enter your new device-specific username and password.
</p>
<h5>Connections from Source Table</h5>
<p>For Trimble units we have these different connections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>VRSCMRX works with the newest Trimble units, newest firmware.
  <li>VRSCMRP works with Trimble units that are newer but may not have the latest updates to the firmware.
  <li>VRSCMR works with older Trimble units.
</ul>
<hr />
<p>For non-Trimble units use these connections.</p>
<ul>
  <li>VRSRTCM32 works with newest non-Trimble units.
  <li>VRSRTCM31 works with non-Trimble units.
  <li>VRSRTCM23 works with older non-Trimble units.
</ul>
<p>All of these give you the network solution. They just deliver it in different ways and in some cases nano-seconds
  slower.</p>
<p>MS_CMR, MS_CMRP, and MS_RTCM31 are for connecting to a single base when you are on the edge of a network or are not
  getting a strong network solution. In these cases, the system will automatically find the closest station and connect
  you.</p>

<h2 class="text-left">Getting Started</h2>
<div class="flex flex--row flex--wrap">
  <span class="one-of-two">
    <h3 class="text-left">Create an Account</h3>

      <code>New Registration</code>, then follow the instructions. The cost is $600 and you now get access to the Nevada
      GPS covering Washoe County in Nevada. You'll need a credit card, and the following information...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Organization (avoid punctuation)
      <li>Login
      <li>Password (8 characters)
