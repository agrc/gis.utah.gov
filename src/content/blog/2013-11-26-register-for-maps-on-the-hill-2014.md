<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/utah.gov/spreadsheet/viewform?usp=drive_web&formkey=dG4ta3dQY3JpWkpCajhsbWNRRjlsT3c6MA#gid=0">Registration is now open</a> for the third annual Maps on the Hill. Maps on the Hill 2014 will be held on Wednesday, <strong>January 29, 2014</strong> from 11:00am - 1:00pm at the Utah State Capitol, with a reception afterwards. This event has been a great success in the past, and is a good opportunity for students and professionals to share maps and mapping projects with elected officials, fellow map makers in Utah, and the public. </p>
<p><em>Who should participate:</em><br />
Individuals: Anybody who makes a map through their work or education.<br />
Organizations: An organization that has worked on multiple mapping projects.</p>
<p><em>Maps on the Hill Event:</em><br />
The event will be held during the 2014 Legislative session on January 29 during the Legislature’s lunch break.<br />
Setup time will begin at 10:30am, take down starts at 1:30pm. We request that at least one participant is present to discuss each map entry from 11:00am to 1:30pm.<br />
Map displays will be set up in the Capitol Rotunda, and the public and elected officials will be able to browse between the many maps.</p>
<p><em>Display Types:</em><br />
You can present hardcopy maps, interactive digital maps (you’ll need to provide a means to show it on a computer), or both.<br />
The focus of the event is interesting maps that are applicable to a wide variety of audiences.<br />
Maps can be of any topic.<br />
This event is not a product/services marketing opportunity, it’s purpose is to show elected officials the cool maps that people in Utah are making.</p>
<p>To participate, all you need to do now is register. This event is free of charge. </a><strong>Register <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/utah.gov/spreadsheet/viewform?usp=drive_web&formkey=dG4ta3dQY3JpWkpCajhsbWNRRjlsT3c6MA#gid=0">here</a>.</strong> You don't need to know what specific map(s) you are going to present until early January, but be thinking about what you or your organization is going to bring, how much space you'll need, and what supplies you'll need UGIC to provide (easels, tables, etc).</p>
