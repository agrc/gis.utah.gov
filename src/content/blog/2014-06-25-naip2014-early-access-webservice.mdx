    National Agricultural Imagery Program (NAIP).
  </a>{' '}
</p>
<p>And, the preliminary 2014 NAIP imagery is available now for use as web services.</p>
<p>
  This year, the Utah NAIP contractors are required to make the preliminary imagery available through an Early Access
  Web Service, approximately 5 business days after an area has been acquired. The coverage area will grow until the
  project is complete (several weeks) and the contractors will continue to make the preliminary imagery web service
  available until 30 days after final delivery of the final Digital Orthophoto Quarter Quads (DOQQs) products. When the
  acquisition is finalized, which is expected to be this Fall, the collection will be statewide 1 meter 4-band imagery
  and will be available as web services and for download from UGRC's servers.
</p>
<p>
  The Early Access Web Service for Utah is now active. It can be accessed as a standalone web service from here:
  http://gissvr.surdex.net/arcgis/rest/services/ImageServices/PILOT_EAWS_UT_2014_4b/ImageServer or by adding an ArcGIS
  Server to an ArcMap session using the following url: https://gissvr.surdex.net/arcgis/services . The imagery is in the
  image services folder (i.e. PILOT_EAWS_UT_2014_4b) and the acquisition dates layer is in the map services folder (i.e.
  NAIP2014UT).
</p>
<p>
  To view the service as a WMS use the following url:
  http://gissvr.surdex.net/arcgis/services/ImageServices/PILOT_EAWS_UT_2014_4b/ImageServer/WMSServer?
