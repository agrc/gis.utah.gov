  The Division of Water Resources (DWRe) at the Department of Natural Resources has created <a href="https://utahdnr.maps.arcgis.com/apps/PublicGallery/index.html?appid=85fc79669ffc421787501a7a9185a980&group=05b76e9c026248c3971ebe9da4f864ae">
    an interactive map gallery using ArcGIS Online
  </a> to showcase all of DWRe's interactive maps in a single location. The interactive map gallery provides easy navigation
  and a static location for finding newly created maps.{' '}
</p>
<p>
  The maps in the gallery range from a basic water resources reference map to a map of the Fremont River and it's local
  reservoirs and diversions. The maps can be used to reference anything related to water resources, such as
  water-related land use, tracking DWRe's projects, and drought conditions/water supply.{' '}
