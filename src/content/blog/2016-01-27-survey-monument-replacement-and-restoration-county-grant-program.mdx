The 2015 Utah Legislative General Session passed Senate Bill 264, which established the Monument Replacement and Restoration Committee (MRRC), as well as funding to establish a County grant program to preserve public land survey monuments ([UCA 63F-1-510](https://le.utah.gov/xcode/Title63F/Chapter1/63F-1-S510.html)). The committee [began meeting in September](/blog/2015-10-30-big-happenings-with-public-land-survey-system-gis), and is now accepting grant applications to restore survey monuments until <strong>February 16, 2016</strong>.

A county wishing to submit an application to the Committee that meets the following requirements:

- Identifies one or more monuments in the county that are in need of protection or rehabilitation.
- Establishes a plan that is consistent with federal law or rule to protect or rehabilitate each monument.
- Requests a specific amount of funding to complete the plan.
