The year is half over and we keep rolling along. This is the Municipal Boundaries update for the second quarter of the 2017 calendar year. Things picked up a little from the [first quarter](/blog/2017-03-29-municipal-boundaries-update-for-first-quarter-calendar-year). _A little reminder for everyone_, **changes to city boundaries can affect you!** For instance, your voting precinct or school district may change.

Be sure to share data with your Clerks office or others that may have an interest.

Following are the changes and annexations since March. 30, 2017, listed by County and City:
