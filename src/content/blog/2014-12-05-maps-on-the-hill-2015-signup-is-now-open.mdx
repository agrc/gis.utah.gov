<p>
  Maps on the Hill, supported by the <a href="https://ugic.org/">Utah Geographic Information Council</a> (UGIC) and
  UGRC, will be held on January 28, 2015. This event, in its fourth year, is a good opportunity for students and
  professionals to share maps, mapping tools, and mapping projects with elected officials, fellow practitioners, and the
  public.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Who should participate:</em>
  <br />
  Individuals: Anybody who makes a map through their work or education.
  <br />
  Organizations: An organization that has worked on multiple mapping projects.

  <em>Maps on the Hill Event:</em>
  <br />
  The map display event will be held the first Wednesday of the 2015 Legislative session, in the Capitol Rotunda from
  10:30 am - 1:30 pm, with set-up time beginning at 9:30am. We request that at least one participant is present to
  discuss each map entry throughout the display event.
</p>
<p>
  <em>Display Types:</em>
  <br />
  You can present hardcopy maps, interactive digital maps (youâ€™ll need to provide a means to show it on a computer), or
  both.
  <br />
  The focus of the event is interesting maps or map technology projects that are applicable to a wide audience. While
  displays can be on any appropriate topic, presentations that may be of interest to decision makers are strongly
  encouraged. Marketing of specific product and services is discouraged.
