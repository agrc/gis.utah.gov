The new 2017 high-resolution Google imagery (6" pixels) is available through UGRC's [Discover server]({% link discover/index.html %})! Updated areas (map below) include the what Google calls the Salt Lake, Heber, Logan, St. George and Tooele blocks which comprise
-most of the Wasatch Front urban area (Brigham City, Weber County, Davis County, Salt Lake County, and Utah County)
-many Wasatch Back communities (Summit, Wasatch and Morgan Counties, and Tooele and Cedar Valley.
-many of the Box Elder and Cache Valley communities
-the St. George metro area
-western Uinta mountains, including much of the Mirror Lake Highway, Strawberry Reservoir, and a northwestern portion of the Unitah Basin

The new imagery is already loaded into the `Google`, `Utah`, `Basemap-Hybrid`, and `Google 2017archive` services. If you're using these services, you don't need to change a thing layer-wise, but you may need to clear your cache (instructions below). The new imagery is also available for download as geo-referenced jpeg files (.jp2) by all organizations that have sign up to use licensed content on the Discover server.

If you have not signed up for access to the Google imagery visit the [Discover - Imagery and Base Map Server]({% link discover/index.html %}) page for details and to access the links needed to request an account.

#### Don't see the updated imagery

**ArcMap/ArcGIS Pro users will need to clear their local caches to see the new imagery.** Users can clear their entire ArcMap/ArcGIS Pro caches or clear caches for just the `Google`, `Utah`, and `Basemap-Hybrid` layers.

#### Cache Clearing Instructions

- **ArcMap** Go to the service’s `Layer Properties -> Cache` tab and select `Clear Local Cache Now`. Be patient as this could take several minutes. If the blurry tiles persist you have the options to `Clear cache when the session ends` or `Don't cache and data locally`. Another option is to completely clear your ArcMap cache by going to `Customize -> ArcMap Options -> Display Cache -> Clear Cache`.

- **ArcGIS Pro** Go to the service’s `Layer Properties -> Cache` tab and select `Clear Cache`. You can also clear your entire Pro cache by going to the Pro project's `Options -> Display` and check `Clear cache` and selecting `OK`.
