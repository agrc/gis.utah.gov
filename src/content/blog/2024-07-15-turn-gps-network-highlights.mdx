Welcome to the latest edition of TURN GPS Network Highlights! We are excited to share the latest advancements and updates in our GPS network that enhance the precision and reliability of real-time GPS corrections in Utah and some surrounding states.

## Expanding GNSS solutions

We are thrilled to announce that the TURN GPS Network has made significant progress in its transition to a full GNSS solution. This enhancement integrates multiple satellite constellations, including GPS, Glonass, Galileo, Beidou, and QZSS, providing our users with more modernized and reliable positioning data.

## Network upgrades

Out of the 65 stations in Utah, 54 are now equipped with full GNSS Trimble Alloys, capable of streaming data from GPS, Glonass, Galileo, BeiDou, and QZSS. This upgrade significantly enhances the ability for users of TURN GPS to work in diverse areas such as steep canyons, near tall buildings and even some tree canopy because of the additional number of satellites available through a full GNSS solution.

Only 11 stations remain with the older NetR9 receivers, which stream data from GPS, Glonass, and Galileo. We are actively working to upgrade these remaining stations to ensure full GNSS capabilities across our network.

## Successful transition to new GPS IP address

We extend our gratitude to all users who helped make the transition to our new server IP address back in August seamless. If you are experiencing connection issues, please ensure you are using the new IP address.

Read our [documentation](/documentation/turn/connecting/) for more details on managing your subscriptions, connecting to the TURN GPS network with the correct IP address, and using the best Mountpoint for your needs.

## National Park Service partnership

We are pleased to announce a new partnership with the National Park Service, allowing us to connect to several stations within the national parks. This partnership enhances our network coverage and reliability in critical areas.

### Partner stations

- Zion National Park, Utah
- Arches National Park, Utah
- Fort Laramie National Site, Wyoming
- Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming
- Death Valley National Park, Edge of Nevada
- Mojave National Preserve, Edge of Nevada

## Website improvements

Visit our improved website at [turngps.utah.gov](https://turngps.utah.gov/), where you can now access our new online bill pay feature. This enhancement simplifies the payment process for our users.

## New NevadaGPS server

We have launched a new NevadaGPS server operating on the NAD83 2011 datum, providing enhanced positioning accuracy for our users in the Nevada region.

Read our [documentation](/documentation/turn/connecting/) for more details on connecting to the NevadaGPS network on either the new NAD83 (2011) datum or the NAD83/94 (HARN).

## Monitoring projects

Our network is actively involved in monitoring critical infrastructure, including the water level and movement of the Great Salt Lake Railroad Causeway. This project underscores our commitment to supporting vital infrastructure with accurate and reliable GNSS data.

Thank you for your continued support and engagement with the TURN GPS Network. We look forward to bringing you more updates and enhancements in the future.
