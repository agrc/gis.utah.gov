<p>Beginning January 16, 2016 UGRC will no longer support legacy Image Server. This means that users of all versions of ArcGIS Desktop will <strong>not</strong> be able to connect to the SGID Image Server (connections established using the <em>Add Image Server Connection</em> button). All links to Image Server saved within an mxd will be broken. </p>
<p>UGRC recommends that <strong>ALL</strong> ArcGIS Desktop users access the aerial photography and scanned map data layers by using the <code>Add Data > GIS Servers</code> method to connect to UGRC's mapserv.utah.gov server. This method accesses these map layers via the ArcGIS Image Extension for Server.
