As you may have noticed, a lot of different things are going on in the world right now. UGRC staff are now working from home, and we’re communicating mostly electronically. We had a few bumps along the way during this transition, but we’re happy to say that throughout these changes, our data has always been available to our users. Also, despite the challenges of this year, we’ve kept busy and the wheels of progress have kept turning. With that in mind, we appreciate your patience on the following delayed municipal boundaries updates.

We are at a total of 56 annexations so far this year, which puts us in similar territory as this same time in previous years. As per usual, Utah County leads the way with the number of annexations, with Cache County following. This year several other counties have joined them (i.e., Iron, Sevier, and Tooele counties), and there is more change coming for Tooele.

As always, feel free to check out all the municipal boundary changes and make sure your boundaries are where you think they should be. You can view them on the [Utah Municipality Modifications web map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63).
To review related documents, go the [Utah Lt. Governor Municipal Certifications website](https://municert.utah.gov/). We will keep you informed of upcoming changes.

The following table shows the changes and annexations (listed by county and city) since December 31, 2019.

Stay safe and healthy, everyone!
