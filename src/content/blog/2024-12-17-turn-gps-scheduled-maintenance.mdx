We would like to inform you of scheduled server maintenance and a GPS network software update taking place on Monday, January 6th, between 9:30 a.m. and 12:30 p.m.

While we anticipate the network will only be down for approximately one hour during this window, we encourage you to notify your field crews of the planned downtime and arrange for an alternative source of real-time corrections, if necessary.

TURN GPS' new functionality highlights are:

- Trimble IonoGuard VRS: Output IonoGuard messages in your VRS corrections.
- VRS offset interpolation: Improved handling of inhomogeneous station coordinates.
- Cyber Security updates for Pivot Web.
- Pivot Telemetry: Help us get a better understanding of your Pivot use and needs.
- Further additions to enhance satellite processing and rover performance.
