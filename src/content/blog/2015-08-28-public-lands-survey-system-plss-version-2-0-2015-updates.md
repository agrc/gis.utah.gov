UGRC recently made available the latest version of the Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB) version 2.0, 2015 updates to the Townships, Sections, and Quarter Section divisions of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) contained in Utahâ€™s State Geographic Information Database (SGID).

The basic units of the PLSS comprise the foundation for public and private property boundaries in Utah. The digital GIS representations of the PLSS in the SGID, while in no way a substitute for physical surveys and monumentation, serve as an important supporting reference for surveying and map-based administrative representations of property extents.

In the next month we will be getting all the contributed PLSS Corner Points integrated with this new BLM version of this feature class and updating it here. Stay tuned we will have more changes on the way.

The Township areas impacted by change in this updated version are shown on the map and include adjustments to the locations of corner points.
