<p>In a <a href="{% link _posts/2013-02-19-arcgis-server-10-1-upgrade.md %}">previous post</a>, we informed you of the changes that will be happening relative to our main ArcGIS Server instance being upgraded to 10.1. This post is to let you know that the switch to the 10.1 servers is happening on the evening of <strong>Friday, March 1st</strong>. We will be testing over the weekend to make sure that there is no interruptions in service.</p>
