With the cool winds blowing in and the birds flying south, fall is officially upon us. That means a few things: warm sweaters, yellow aspen leaves, and everyone's favorite method of getting a free sticker: voting! Election Day will be on Tuesday, November 5th, 2024. If you aren't yet registered, do it now on [vote.utah.gov](http://vote.utah.gov) and vote by mail or in person! Did you know that where you vote and who's on your ballot are determined by geospatial data maintained by UGRC and local government authorities?

UGRC might not be able to make the beautiful autumn hues of red, orange, and yellow stay longer than their natural time, but we are charged with safekeeping the data that makes elections in Utah possible. An example of these data are the [digital polygon representations](/products/sgid/political/voter-precincts/) of voting precinct boundaries. Maintaining these boundaries requires collaboration, organization, and a great attention to detail. Part of [our mission](/about/) as geospatial leaders in Utah is to “ensure a high level of coordination among Utah GIS users and effective, efficient use of GIS resources.” And boy oh boy, does making elections happen demand a lot of coordination. So, let's take a moment and get to know what's involved with keeping the data side of democracy alive.

All 29 counties in the state have public servants, often the County Recorders and Clerks, in charge of surveying, recording, and verifying their county boundaries and voting precincts. Each county submits these datasets many months before election day. Their schemas often differ slightly to meet each county's unique needs, so UGRC adjusts them to a standardized schema, ensures their spatial accuracy, and adds them to the statewide datasets. The completed boundaries are then used in elections at all levels—city, county, state, and federal.

Without these geographic boundaries, votes could be double-counted, counted in the wrong county, or not counted at all. That's why each dataset must pass a rigorous screening process to ensure accuracy. Once ballots have been sent out prior to election day, these boundaries cannot be altered or adjusted in any way until after the election results have been certified. After the election, voters can access election outcome maps available on Utah's official [election results website](https://electionresults.utah.gov/results/public/utah/elections/PrimaryCD2Recount2024).

The State of Utah's use of GIS in election operations is part of a wider effort to include geospatial technology in democratic processes in the United States. According to a [2022 report](https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/assets/docs/GEE/2022_October_StateElectionDirectorReport_final.pdf) prepared by the National States Geographic Information Council, 90% of states in the US report that their voter registration system will incorporate GIS within the next five years. This is great news for voters: it means greater accuracy, transparency, and clarity for US elections.
