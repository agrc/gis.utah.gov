We are halfway through 2023 and the annexations are slowing down. Hopefully that is not related to the flooding or the threat of. This quarter we got the latest (July 1, 2022) population estimates for the towns and cities and the `POPLASTESTIMATE` field reflecs those changes.

Be sure to check out all the changes that have been made and to make sure your boundaries are where they should be. View them on the [Utah Municipality Modifications map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63). All recent annexation documents can be viewed on the [Utah Lt. Governor Municipal Certifications](https://demosite.utah.gov/gov-entity/boundary-certifications-by-year/) website.
