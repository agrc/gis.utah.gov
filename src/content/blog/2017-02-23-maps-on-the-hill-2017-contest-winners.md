In an effort to reward the best work at Maps on the Hill 2017, a judged contest was added to this year’s event in the capitol rotunda. Recognition and small prizes (UGRC wall maps and ESRI press books) were awarded to the map displays that best conveyed the value of GIS-based solutions. ![Judges' Deliberations](/images/404.png)

A four judge panel, consisting of Beth Overhuls (Salt Lake County CIO), Evan Curtis (Governor’s Office of Management and Budget), Lance Newman (Dean, Westminster College Arts & Sciences), and Mike Hussey (State CIO), rated the map displays for overall effectiveness, visual appeal, data integration, and innovation.

### This year’s winners are:



![FFSL Map Booklet Page](/images/404.png)**UGIC 2017 Maps on the Hill - Best of Show**

- Division of Forestry Fire and State Lands (FFSL) - Wildfire Risk (11)

**UGIC 2017 Maps on the Hill - Awards of Excellence**

- City of West Jordan - Sewer and Sidewalk Infrastructure (18, 31)
- Division of Wildlife Resources - Wildlife Tracking (10,41)
- Salt Lake City Public Utilities - Infrastructure Mapping (26-28)
- Utah State Remote Sensing/GIS Lab - Sage Grouse Habitat (13,36)

While the contest was based on the physical display at the event, the page numbers for the corresponding entry in this year’s [Maps on the Hill pdf booklet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oKenAht7HQn_LFMe0dIvjwFsVQ08bnpT/view?usp=sharing) are shown in parentheses.

In the inaugural MOTH contest, the winning FFSL entry went so far as to deploy a made-special-for-the-event simulated campfire to complement their excellent map-based information on wildfire risk across the state. That sets the bar high for those thinking about competing for next year’s crown!

Thanks again to our judges, participants, and volunteers for your part in making this a great event!
