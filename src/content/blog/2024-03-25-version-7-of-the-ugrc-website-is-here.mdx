title: Version 7 of the UGRC website is here
description: Today we released version 7 of our agency website. We streamlined navigation making it easier than ever to find the information, data, and services you need. All of our content is oganized into 5 pillars -- Products, Solutions, Documentation, and Collaboaration for easier browsing no matter your expertise level. We greatly improved the website and SGID index search to decrease the time it will take you to find website and SGID content. We implemented the Utah Design System so that every page on our website feels familiar and intuitive. Speed was a top priority and this website will load fast for you everywhere with almost perfect Lighthouse scores.

After months of hard work, we're thrilled to deploy version 7 of our UGRC website! We streamlined navigation making it easier than ever to find the information, data, and services you need. All of our content is oganized into 5 pillars -- [Products](/products), [Solutions](/solutions), [Documentation](/documentation), and [Collaboaration](/collaboaration) for easier browsing no matter your expertise level. We greatly improved the website and [SGID index search](/products/sgid/sgid-index) to decrease the time it will take you to find website and SGID content. We implemented the [Utah Design System][] so that every page on our website feels familiar and intuitive. Speed was a top priority and this website will load fast for you everywhere with almost perfect [Lighthouse](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/overview/) scores.

The last time we were able to write a post like this was [8 years ago](/blog/2016-03-25-about-our-new-v6-website-in-ghpages). A lot has changed, but our usage of git and GitHub has stayed the same. Be sure to follow and thank all of the [contributors](/collaboration/community/contributors/) that have helped us get to this point.

This time, the primary driver for a release was to implement the [Utah Design System][]. You should notice all Department of Government Operation websites releasing this month or in the near future implementing the design system. We are excited to be a part of this initiative and to have a website that is consistent with the rest of the state. There are many more changes that we're excited to share with you. We hope you enjoy the new website and find it a huge improvement. Please let us know if you have any feedback or suggestions. We're always looking for ways to improve. Thank you for visiting and using our website!
