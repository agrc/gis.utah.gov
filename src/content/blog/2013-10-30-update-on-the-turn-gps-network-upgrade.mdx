  As announced in a previous{' '}
  <a href="/blog/2013-09-13-turn-gps-network-updates" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    blogpost
  </a>
  , the TURN GPS network is undergoing a system upgrade and a change in spatial reference from NAD 83 (CORS 96) epoch 2002
  to NAD 83 (2011) epoch 2010. We are pleased to announce the new system is up and running and is currently in the testing
  phase. The two systems are running completely separate and independent of each other to avoid any confusion with the coordinate
  systems.{' '}
</p>
<p>
  This spreadsheet shows the coordinate comparison between NAD 83 (CORS 96) and NAD 83 (2011). You may notice from the
  data there is no evidence of a consistent shift in a single direction at a set distance which indicates a new site
  calibration is necessary to use the new system on existing projects.
