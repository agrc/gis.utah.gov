<p>Maps on the Hill is this coming Monday, January 28, 2013 from 11:00am to 1:30pm in the Utah State Capitol Building Rotunda. Maps on the Hill is sponsored by the <a href="https://ugic.org/">Utah Geographic Information Council</a> (UGIC).</p>
<p>Utah's elected officials and the public are invited to come learn about the various mapping projects from professionals and students around Utah. The event is expected to draw over 50 map exhibits from all levels of government, private sector firms, and higher education. Maps on the Hill is a great way to learn about how current mapping technology is being applied to important issues across a wide range of disciplines, including land ownership, health, addressing, emergency preparedness, history and utilities.</p>
