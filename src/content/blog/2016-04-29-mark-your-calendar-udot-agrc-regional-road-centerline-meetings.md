Utah's statewide road centerline dataset, built in partnership with local government GIS staff expertise, is a highly valued state data asset.

New program requirements in the NG911, CAD, DOT, and other application areas, warrant re-examination of the current processes for maintaining what is already excellent GIS roads data.

UDOT and UGRC have planned 4 regional discussion sessions around the state during the first week in June. If you're a road centerline data steward, you will soon receive an invitation and additional information. The tentative dates/times for these workshops are:

- Northern Utah, June 6, 1p-5p, **Location** Logan City Hall 290 N 100 W Logan Utah
- Wasatch Front, June 7, 8:30a-12:30p, **Location** UDOT Region 2 Office 2010 S 2760 W, Salt Lake City
- Southern Utah, June 8, 8:30a-12:30p, **Location** Room 6 (2nd Floor) in The Heritage Center 105 N 100 E Cedar City
- Eastern Utah, June 9, 8:30a-12:30p, **Location** Carbon County Courthouse Commission Chambers 751 E 100 N Price
