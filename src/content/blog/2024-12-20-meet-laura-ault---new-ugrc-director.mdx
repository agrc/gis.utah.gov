## Meet the new director of UGRC!

We are excited to announce that we have a new director here at the Utah Geospatial Resource Center! Laura Ault joined UGRC earlier this fall and we are happy to have her on our team!

## Tell us about your background.

I grew up in Logan, Utah. I spent many days skiing at the Beav, but finally managed to graduate from USU with a bachelor's degree in Landscape Architecture. I headed to grad school back east where I discovered I didn't want to be a traditional landscape architect, dropped out and headed back to Logan (and the Beav). I ended up with a master's degree in Bioregional Planning from the College of Natural Resources at USU. From there I took a job digitizing parcels at the Governor's Office of Planning and Budget, moved over to the Public Lands Policy Office (PLPCO) after a few years to manage the RS 2477 process, then on to the Division of Forestry, Fire and State Lands (FFSL). At FFSL I had a number of cool jobs coordinating programs, Forest Legacy, Sovereign Lands, and Shared Stewardship. After 11 years I became the deputy director at PLPCO for a couple of years before getting this awesome job at UGRC.

## What got you interested in GIS?

I took a GIS class during my undergraduate work and really enjoyed it. I also had great professors at USU who were geospatial believers. What really did it for me was during my short stint in graduate school back east, Jack Dangermond lectured in a class I was in and showed off what ESRI was working on at the time. I was blown away and decided GIS was the way. I dropped out at the end of the semester and headed back to USU (and the Beav).

## What's your favorite map and what does it display? 

The [geologic map compiled by Lehi Hintze](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Prodesc/proddesc_66427.htm) and published by the Utah Geological (and Mineral) Survey in 1980. I'm a sucker for the color scheme. 

## What's your favorite trail in Utah?

A tie between D-Street to the Ridge at the Beav and the A, B, and C sections of the Green River. 

## Something about you that most people don't know?

I was the Logan High School mascot, Grizzwald. Super intimidating 5'4‚Äù grizzly bear!

## What is something about the future of UGRC that excites you?

The ability we have to work with all state agencies and local governments to put data in the hands of decision makers.
