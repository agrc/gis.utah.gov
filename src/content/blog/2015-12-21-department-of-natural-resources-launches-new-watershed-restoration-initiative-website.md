<p>The Department of Natural Resource's Division of Wildlife Resources recently launched a new website, geo-database, and project proposal site for Utah's Watershed Restoration Initiative (WRI). WRI is a partnership program in Utah to improve high priority watersheds throughout the state. WRI is sponsored by the Utah Partners for Conservation and Development and is in its 11th year.  </p>
<p>DWR worked closely with the Department of Technology Services and UGRC over the last year to completely re-write the web application that manages all WRI projects from proposed to complete. One goal of the rewrite was to improve public accessibility to WRI projects through an advanced search and enhanced map interface. To explore WRI projects visit the <a href="https://wri.utah.gov/wri/">project proposal site</a>, to learn more about WRI visit the <a href="https://watershed.utah.gov/">WRI website</a>.     </p>
