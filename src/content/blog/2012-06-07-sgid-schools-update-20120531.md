Updates were made recently to the SGID10.Society.Schools feature class that resides on the Utah SGID ArcSDE database server.

Based on information provided by the Utah State Office of Education (as of February 2012), the update includes various enhancements to the geographic location of schools, address and contact information, and new point locations of schools built since the dataset was originally created in November 2010.

In the upcoming weeks, the schema for the Schools data will be simplified and additional updates and improvements will be made to the data itself.
