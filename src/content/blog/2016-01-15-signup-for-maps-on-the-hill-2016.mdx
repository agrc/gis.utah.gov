<p>
  Maps on the Hill, supported by the Utah Geographic Information Council (UGIC) and UGRC, will be held on March 1, 2016.
  This event, in its fifth year, is a good opportunity for students and professionals to share maps, mapping tools, and
  mapping projects with elected officials, fellow practitioners, and the public.

  <em>Who should participate:</em>
</strong>
Individuals: Anybody who makes a map through their work or education. Organizations: An organization that has worked on multiple
mapping projects.
<strong>Maps on the Hill Event:</strong>
The map display event will be held during the 2016 Legislative session, in the Capitol Rotunda from 10:00 am – 1:00 pm, with
set-up time beginning at 9:00am. We request that at least one participant is present to discuss each map entry throughout
the display event.
<strong>
  <em>Display Types:</em>
</strong>
You can present hardcopy maps, interactive digital maps (you’ll need to provide a means to show it on a computer), or both.
<p>
  The focus of the event is interesting maps or map technology projects that are applicable to a wide audience. While
  displays can be on any appropriate topic, presentations that may be of interest to decision makers are strongly
  encouraged. Marketing of specific product and services is discouraged.
</p>
<strong>
  <em>Book</em>:
</strong>
The book has always been a great example of the interesting maps created and used in Utah. This year the mapbook will
focus on how data is created and used. More information on displays, the book, and other details will be sent to
participants sometime after they signup.
