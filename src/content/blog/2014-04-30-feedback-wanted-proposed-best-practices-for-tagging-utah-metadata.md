<p><img src="deleted" alt="" title="tagexample2" width="500" height="151" class="inline-text-right" />UGRC has developed a <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/utah.gov/document/d/1V7lnrMX6Ufok3lmSoxVaBJhwWnvlyPRb6v8kNzSjlQ4/edit">draft 'best practices' document for assigning metadata tags</a> to esri 'Item Description'-style metadata.</p>
<p>Tags play an important role in search optimization in both ArcGIS Online and Esri's newly released Open Data platform.</p>
<p>The creation of this draft was driven by UGRC preparations for the GIS data resources in Utah's State Geographic Information Database (SGID) to work optimally these two and other environments.</p>
<p>Feedback on the best practices document is encouraged and can be provided within the google doc by right clicking and selecting 'Comment'. Thank you in advance for your input!</p>
