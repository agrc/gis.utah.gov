As of December 31, 2020, UGRC's SGID10 database has been deprecated. At this point, it is no longer our “star player”.

As a reminder, the replacement offerings include web services and data downloads via our [Open Data site](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/) as well as direct database access via the [Open SGID](/documentation/sgid/open-sgid). You can read more about choosing the right data source on our [SGID data page](/products/sgid).

Here are a few related resources to get you connected:

- [SGID Open Data site](https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/) (ESRI Hub site)
- Open SGID database (PostgreSQL/PostGIS database)
  - [Connect to the Open SGID](/documentation/sgid/open-sgid) database
  - Find issue tracking and solutions relating to the Open SGID via the [Open SGID GitHub repo](https://github.com/agrc/open-sgid)
  - Read our blog post from May 2020 [introducing the Open SGID](/blog/2020-05-04-introducing-open-sgid)

Our goal is to provide better access to SGID data. We feel that these new offerings are more in line with the current technology and that they reach a wider audience.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have questions.
