Geographic coordinates for Utah addresses can now be located using the UGRC's Web API. This is the same API that are used by UGRC web applications.

[API Explorer](https://api.mapserv.utah.gov)

The geocoding-related endpoints currently include single address geocoding, reverse geocoding, route and milepost lookup. The APIs and their parameters can be viewed and tested using the [API Explorer](https://api.mapserv.utah.gov).

The street zone geocoding endpoint will accept a 5 digit zip code or common city names and abbreviations.

Sample code for geocoding an address is available via [github](https://github.com/agrc/GeocodingSample).
