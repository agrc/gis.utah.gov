Through its Geospatial Excellence Awards, the [National States Geographic Information Council (NSGIC)](https://nsgic.org) recognizes individuals and organizations that advance the capabilities of geospatial technology, and promote NSGICâ€™s goals of efficient and effective government.

At NSGIC's Annual Conference this September, two of the national geospatial excellence awards ([see all](https://nsgic.memberclicks.net/2017-NSGIC-awards0)) went to Utah-led initiatives.

**Champion Award**: _Utah Governor's Office of Economic Development_

Utah's Governor's Office of Economic Development, through its Broadband Outreach Center and Office of Outdoor Recreation, has championed the use of GIS and enterprise mapping initiatives to deliver value to Utah citizens and businesses. Projects include residential broadband mapping, commercial broadband availability, trail and recreational amenities GIS data layers, partner funding for high resolution aerial photography, and locate.utah.gov - Utah's award-winning state economic development interactive map. In particular, **_Kelleigh Cole_**, Director of GOED's broadband center, has been an active, supporting, and connecting partner to Utah GIS for the past 6+ years.

**Catalyst Award**: _Utah Land Information Records (LIR) Initiative_

The Utah Land Information Records workgroup, a multi-agency partnership of state and local government was formed and facilitated by **_Evan Curtis_**, the State Planning Coordinator in the Governor's Office. Over several months, the group defined a best practice for the voluntary sharing of annual, detailed tax parcel data. This included conceptual recommendations and content guidance in the form of a data model. In its first year, 20 of 29 Utah counties contributed to this open, statewide GIS data layer that is used to support economic development, public safety, planning, and other important application areas. **_Rodney Bennett_**, 2016 Chair of the Utah Assessors Association, and **_Ted Knowlton_**, Deputy Director of Wasatch Front Regional Council, provided instrumental facilitation to the discussions that formed Utah's approach to sharing this valued information.
