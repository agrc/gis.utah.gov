Through partnerships with the USGS, State, and local government, UGRC is pleased to announce the new acquisition and availability of 2,110 square miles of 12.5cm (~5 inch) resolution 4-band aerial photography imagery.

This public domain imagery is the latest addition to the State Geographic Information Database's (SGID) High Resolution Orthophotography (HRO) collection. The imagery was collected between March 28 and June 1 of 2012.

The HRO 2012 imagery can be viewed and downloaded from UGRC's <a href="https://raster.utah.gov/?cat=HRO%202012%20(12.5cm)">interactive map.

The imagery was collected by [Aero-Graphics](https://www.aero-graphics.com/) based in Salt Lake City. Here is an overview of the data collection effort:

- 12,904 exposures acquired at a 12.5 cm ground sample distance (GSD).
- 247 flight lines flown with a Vexcel UltraCamX digital camera system.
- 60% side and 80% forward overlap over downtown SLC and the U of U (to minimize building lean).
- 4-band GeoTIFF delivery of 1,436 tiles in 2000m x 2000m tiles (roughly 1GB each).
- UGRC supplied local ground control which was used with supplemental aero-graphics control from other projects.
- Covers entire Wasatch Front from North Ogden to Santaquin, including Wasatch Mountains.
- Horizontal accuracy standard was +/- 37.5cm at or above a 95% confidence level.

We'd like to thank our partners for helping to make this acquisition happen with funding and/or quality control assistance: USGS, Salt Lake County (and their city partners), Weber County, and UDOT.
