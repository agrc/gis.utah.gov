It is the end of another long year and, ready or not, 2023 is here. It was another year of growth for the state which has slowed down some. The top contributors were Utah and Cache County once again with 23 annexations in Utah and 16 in Cache. 5 other counties had between 5 to 7 annexations in 2022. There was a tie for the biggest growing city, with 6 annexations, between Utah County's Lehi and Sevier County's Richfield. The State's total for the year is 90 annexations. This breaks down to 84 annexations, 3 disconnections, 2 adjustments, and 1 incorporation. This is similar to the last couple of years.

The latest incorporation was in Tooele County again this year. Everyone join us in welcoming the city of Lake Point. Lake Point is the 250th city in Utah alongside 5 Metro Townships. Enjoy these facts for your next Trivia round.

We would like to thank all of the hardworking recorders and staff in the counties and towns. With your help, the Lieutenant Governor's Office and UGRC processed all of the annexations, adjustments, disconnections, and incorporations for the state.

Our annual submission to the US Census Bureau Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS) program will be completed by next month. All of the updates from 2022 will be submitted. Boundary updates will be reflected in the American Community Survey (ACS) and Population Estimates Program (PEP) data estimates and in next year's BAS materials.

As always feel free to view all the changes and make sure your boundaries are where you think they should be by viewing them on the [Utah Municipality Modifications map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63). To review any specific annexation document, visit the [Utah Lt. Governor Municipal Certifications](https://demosite.utah.gov/gov-entity/boundary-certifications-by-year/) website. _This website is in a transition phase so it may change in the future_.

The following table shows the changes and annexations (listed by county and city) from the 2022 year:
