Through partnerships with FEMA and the Utah Division of Emergency Management, USGS, Utah Geological Survey, and the Salt Lake County Surveyor's office and partner cities, UGRC is pleased to announce the new 2013-2014 Wasatch Front Lidar is now available. The 1,422 square miles of USGS Quality Level 1 Lidar was collected as an 8 point per meter (8 ppm) point cloud. The resulting bare earth hydro flattened (DTM) DEMs and first return or highest-hit (DSM) DEMs have a resolution of .5 meters.

This public domain elevation data is the latest addition to the State Geographic Information Databaseâ€™s (SGID) elevation data collection. This dataset was collected during the late Fall of 2013 and the Spring of 2014. It will be put to work for a diverse set of uses including: the RiskMap modernization of flood hazard maps, fault studies, transportation project design, infrastructure mapping, solar energy quantification, and tree and vegetation studies.

The 2013-2014 Wasatch Front Lidar can be downloaded through the [UGRC Raster Data Discovery](https://raster.utah.gov/?cat=.5%20Meter%20%7B2013-2014%20LiDAR%7D) application.

The imagery was collected by WSI, now a Quantum Spatial company, based out of Portland, OR. Here is an overview of the data collection effort:

- 74 days on project for the vendor with 52 flight missions
- 50% side overlap between flight lines
- Scan angle of 28 degrees from nadir
- Collected at 1,400 meter above the ground level
- 0.5 meter bare earth hydro flattened (DTM) DEMs and first return / highest-hit (DSM) DEMs in Imagine .img format in 2000m x 2000m tiles (63mb each)
- 8 point per meter (8 ppm) LAS 1.2 point cloud with minimum (ground, water, unassigned) classification in 1000m x 1000m tiles (approx. 450mb each)
- 0.5 meter GeoTIFF Intensity Images
- FGDC Metadata
- Covers the urbanized areas of Salt Lake and Utah County and the Wasatch Fault from Malad, ID south into Sanpete County
- Vertical accuracy within +/- 9.25cm
