<p><img src="/images/404.png" class="inline-text-left" loading="lazy" />Lieutenant Governor Greg Bell announced the launch of the <a href="https://elections.utah.gov/map/district-maps">Political District Maps website</a>. The website will display interactive maps of the state house, state senate, state school board and congressional districts recently passed by the Utah State Legislature.  The districts represented by these maps take effect on January 1, 2012, for electoral purposes and on January 1, 2013, for all other purposes. The public will be able to study the maps online and print off static renderings of each new district.</p>
<p>“I am thrilled with the launch of this new website,” said Lieutenant Governor Greg Bell in a press release. “We are excited to be able to provide detailed information on the new districts to the citizens of our state. We are always striving to provide the best possible election information to our voters and candidates and this new website fits in perfectly with that goal.”</p>
<p>The site was built by UGRC leveraging its <a href="/products/base-maps">basemap cache services</a> for a simple, effective user interface.  This web application takes the place of the Redistricting Reference Book published by the State Legislature in 2001, saving significant resources in printing and distribution.  Moreover, the site offers a variety of printing options - from whole districts, to custom views.</p>
<p>The site provides a central resource for all citizens.  Look for new enhancements as 2012 election dates closer.</p>
