<p><img src="{% link images/GPSNetwork_March2014-291x300.png %}" alt="" title="GPSNetwork_March2014" width="291" height="300" class="inline-text-left" />On April 1, 2014 the State of Utah UGRC will complete its upgrade of the legacy software platform for The Utah Reference Network GPS (TURN GPS) to the new Trimble Pivot Platform. UGRC has provided many updates on the progress of this upgrade to existing users who should be prepared now for the old system final shutdown date on April 1.</p>
<p>The Pivot platform offers several new features that improve functionality for both system administrators and the end users, some of which are mobile apps for monitoring the health of the system while in the field. Please keep in mind that the coordinate frame on the new platform has been updated to North American Datum of 1983, 2011 adjustment published by the National Geodetic Survey (NGS). </p>
<p>Pivot runs on a Windows 2008 virtual server. The new 64 bit system provides greatly improved processing capabilities which allows the network to expand its subscriber base, the number of base stations, and to grow other innovative uses of the system.</p>
<p>8 new stations have been added covering the southwestern corner of Utah and the Las Vegas area. This widens and strengthens the coverage area and is available at no extra subscription cost. </p>
<p>A map showing the station locations and health of the stations can be viewed <a href="http://168.179.231.9/Map/SensorMap.aspx">here</a>. </p>
<p>Many of the new stations throughout the entire network are capable of receiving data from multiple satellite constellations including satellites from the USA GPS system, Russian GLONASS System, European Galileo and the Chinese COMPASS System.  </p>
<p>TURN GPS currently has over 300 subscribed users, the number of which is increasing as the word gets out about this valuable resource.</p>
