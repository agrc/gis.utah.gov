Jordan School District and Murray School District have mutually agreed to a boundary adjustment as described below:

> The portion of Murray City that resides in Jordan School District boundaries be moved to be within Murray School District’s boundaries. Thus, the Boundary of Murray City and Murray School District will be the same and Jordan School District will no longer have any portion of Murray City within Jordan School District’s boundary. It is the intent with this boundary adjustment to remove confusion among the residents in the area as to which school district a) serves their students, b) represents them, and c) levies and receives their taxes.

All changes are represented in UGRC data now and are [available for download](/products/sgid/boundaries/school-districts/).
