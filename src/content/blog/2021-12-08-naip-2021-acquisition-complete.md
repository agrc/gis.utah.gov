We are pleased to announce the 2021 aerial photography acquisition is finally completed. This acquisition will provide statewide 60cm 4-band imagery from the NAIP program and 15cm imagery for our licensed users. With fires, smoke, and a pandemic, this year's acquisition was a challenging one. Please be patient as we will provide services of the new imagery as soon as possible.
