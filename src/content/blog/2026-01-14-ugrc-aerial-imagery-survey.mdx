The Utah Geospatial Resource Center (UGRC) is planning the next phase of our statewide high-resolution aerial photography program. Your feedback is critical to ensure the imagery meets your professional needs and to secure funding to maintain the service.

We want to hear from you on:

- Technical Standards: Are resolution, update frequency, and coverage meeting your needs?
- Operational Use Cases: How is this imagery currently used by you and your office?
- Impact & Testimonials: Why is this service vital to your workflow(s)?

**Please provide your feedback by completing our [brief survey](https://feedback.utah.gov/jfe/form/SV_0HY8gNhH6v40g86) by February 10th.**
