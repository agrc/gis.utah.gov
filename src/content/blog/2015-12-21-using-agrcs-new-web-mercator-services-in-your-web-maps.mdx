  <a href="/documentation/discover/clients/">Using Discover services with the Esri JavaScript API v4.x</a> contains more
  current information.
</p>

<p>
  Recently, UGRC, in conjunction with DNR, hosted an{' '}
  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wch2M2rBJhU">open house</a> discussing UGRC’s base map and imagery
  strategies. During this open house, UGRC discussed details of new web mercator (WGS84) base maps as the default
  presentation layer moving forward. Most of the UTM base maps have been converted to web mercator and are hosted and
  served through discover.agrc.utah.gov. <strong>The plan is to sunset the UTM base maps at the end of 2016.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  While upgrading the UTM base maps to web mercator, UGRC decided to modify the map services offered. Based on usage
  analytics and user feedback, the hillshade and vector base map were removed. The Hybrid service was replaced by
  combining the Google imagery service and a new overlay service (a long-requested feature allowing users to “sandwich”
  their data within the base map). The Lite, Terrain and Topo base maps were converted with no changes. Finally, there
  is a new Color Infrared service derived from the 2011 NAIP.

  The new services are delivered via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_Map_Tile_Service">WMTS</a>. WMTS is an
  OGC standard for delivering tiled map data. The Esri JavaScript API provides a class for consuming with these services
  called a <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/webtiledlayer-amd.html">WebTiledLayer</a>. Using this
  class is as simple as passing in the URL to the WMTS service with the appropriate level, column and row tokens. For
  example:
</p>
<p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/stdavis/67de602cd095dd3fcf3c.js"></script>
</p>
<p>
  You’ll notice that the URL to the service includes a quad word that is unique to your organization and project. If you
  don’t have an account set up or a quad word, you can{' '}
  <a href="/documentation/discover/licensed-imagery/">register on our website</a> to get started.
  <strong>
    {' '}
    If you are planning on putting your quad word into a website or somewhere that it is publicly accessible, you will need
    to contact <Contacts inline subject={frontmatter.title} contactKey="discover" /> to receive a special quad word for licensing
    reasons.
  </strong>{' '}
</p>
<p>
  All of our base maps are cached from levels 5 through 19 with the exception of Topo which is cached to level 17. The
  Google imagery service has an additional level, 20, to allow users to take full advantage of the high resolution (6”
  pixels). You can see a table of min and max zoom levels on the{' '}
  <a href="https://discover.agrc.utah.gov/layer">discover.agrc.utah.gov website</a>. This can create problems when using
  the Esri JavaScript API <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/map-amd.html">map class</a>. The map
  sets the zoom levels based on the first layer that is added to it. For example, if a service is added to the map that
  is cached to level 19 and then the Google imagery service is added, the map will not allow you to zoom into level
  20.{' '}
</p>
<p>
  WebTiledLayer and WMTS integrate together slightly different than{' '}
  <a href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/jsapi/arcgistiledmapservicelayer-amd.html">
    ArcGISTiledMapServiceLayer
  </a>{' '}
  and ArcGIS Server cached map services. The main caveat being ArcGIS services store metadata about the service that
  WebTiledLayers do not. The piece of metadata that will affect developers the most is the cache level information.
  WebTiledLayers cache levels are based on a suggested set that is common amongst popular tile providers. The suggested
  set uses 0 through 19. If the tile set you are using deviates from these levels, you will be responsible for setting
  those values or you will not be given the UI to see the full tile set. As you can see in the sample below it takes a
  fair amount of work.

  <script src="https://gist.github.com/stdavis/6e5c721d50401ddbf126.js"></script>
</p>
<p>
  UGRC has a new widget called the <a href="https://github.com/agrc-widgets/layer-selector">layer-selector</a> that
  handles these issues as well as makes working with base maps more streamlined. It’s main purpose is to provide users
  the ability to quickly switch between base maps and toggle associated overlays.
</p>
<p>Base maps and overlays can be defined by passing in layer factories that define a constructor and parameters.</p>
<p>
  <script src="https://gist.github.com/stdavis/b8582911f12e45bfb873.js"></script>
</p>
<p>
  Alternatively, developers can pass in their discover.agrc.utah.gov quad word and simple token strings that are
  associated with each of the UGRC base maps. This greatly simplifies the amount of code required.

  We hope that this new widget will help ease your transition to the new web mercator services. The layer selector{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/agrc-widgets/layer-selector">code</a> is on Github and is registered on{' '}
  <a href="https://bower.io/search/?q=agrc-layer-selector">bower</a> as "agrc-layer-selector". More{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/agrc-widgets/layer-selector/blob/master/doc/Readme.md">documentation</a> and{' '}
  <a href="https://github.com/agrc-widgets/layer-selector/tree/master/tests">examples</a> can be found in the
  repository. If you run into any trouble please use the{' '}
