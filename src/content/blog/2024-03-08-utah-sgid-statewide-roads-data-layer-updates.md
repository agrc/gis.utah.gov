UGRC recently completed updates to the SGID Roads data layer. Please visit our [Roads and Highway System](/products/sgid/transportation/road-centerlines) data page where you will find information about the Roads data model, as well as a web service layer to the SGID Roads data and direct download links in shapefile and geodatabase format.

These updates are also reflected in UGRC's [address locators](/products/sgid/address), Utah's [Next-Generation 911 GIS database](/products/sgid/911), and UGRC's [street network analysis datasets](/products/sgid/transportation/street-network).
