<p>The Salt Lake City Geoportal project was created by the Digital Scholarship Lab at the University of Utah Marriott Library. The project is designed to examine changes that have taken place and the impacts which have resulted. The maps show present day information as well as information from 1935-1952. The project has also digitized many historical <a href="http://campusguides.lib.utah.edu/utahsanbornfireinsurancemaps">Sanborn Fire Insurance Maps</a>, which are an excellent resource for planning. </p>
<p>The Salt Lake City Geoportal was created with a lot of uses in mind, which include uses for geographers, homeowners, and teachers. The data lets a user determine historic context for a given area, discover historic lot information, and explore the history of Salt Lake City in general.</p>
