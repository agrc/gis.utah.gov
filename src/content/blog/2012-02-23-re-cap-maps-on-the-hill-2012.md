<p><img src="{% link images/DSC_07001.jpg %}" class="inline-text-right" /> Mapping professionals and students were invited to showcase their projects for legislators and the public during the 2012 Session of the Utah Legislature. The goal of the event was to provide a platform for mapping professionals and students to share their hard work with Utah’s elected leaders. Maps on the Hill highlights the critical role that geospatial information plays at all levels of decision making. The event attracted map makers from all backgrounds including local, state, and federal government, private companies, and higher education.</p>
