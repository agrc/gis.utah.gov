We developed the document to help users who might be unfamiliar using enterprise RDBMS backed SDE databases to understand our data organization goals and possibly use as a starting point for their own storage decisions.</p>
<p>In the document you will find suggestions relating to attribute schemas, the geometry specifications that we use for the State Geographic Information Database (SGID) and how to make use of it within the SDE environment, as well as other conventions and processes weâ€™ve developed over the years.</p>
