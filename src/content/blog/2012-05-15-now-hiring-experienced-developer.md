<p>[/note] You are a combat-hardened, grizzled C# up and comer with a few years of coding experience under your belt. You’ve been using the .NET framework long enough to know the ins-and-outs of threading, reflection, generics, and lambdas. You’ve done a fair share of ASP.NET and know how to use AJAX and Javascript frameworks like JQuery to good advantage. You’re open to improving the design and reliability of your code through Agile and/or Test-Driven Development.</p>
<p>You are NOT the type of developer to just get things working without knowing exactly how and why they work. And while you’ve put out some pretty advanced, complex code, you’ve come to the realization that good code is simple code. If the developer sitting next to you can’t open your code and pick up where you’ve left off, your code isn’t that great after all.</p>
<p>While your code might be solid and you know a ton of stuff, you are constantly learning. You digest technical blogs and books for meals and try to stay on top of relevant technologies and patterns.</p>
<p>Aside from your technical ability, you pride yourself on getting things done. You’ve used methodologies and standards with a group of developers and know that sticking to the process helps everyone crank out quality work and get it out the door on time. You have a super-strong attention to detail and you take pride in your work. You’ve mentored junior developers and know when to hold their hand and when to let them beat their head against the wall for a while.</p>
<p>Finally, you might even know a lot more than the organization itself is ready for.  But with your patience, leadership, and guidance, you will be able to guide UGRC into a new realm of advanced technologies and services. You lead by example, set a high standard, and enjoy working in an open, casual environment. You know when to be firm and draw the line, and when to solicit contributions and feedback from the group.  By the way, salary is commensurate with your experience.</p>
