<p><a href="/images/404.png"><img src="/images/404.png" alt="" title="NewPLSS_LrgSample" width="140" height="130" class="inline-text-right" /></a>On April 30, UGRC published Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB) version 2.0 to the townships, sections, and quarter section divisions of the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) contained in Utah's State Geographic Information Database (SGID).</p>
<p>The basic units of the PLSS comprise the foundation for public and private property boundaries in Utah. The digital GIS representations of the PLSS in the SGID, while in no way a substitute for physical surveys and monumentation, serve as an important supporting reference for surveying and map-based administrative representations of property extents.</p>

The major areas impacted by change in this version are shown on the map image at right (click map to enlarge) and include adjustments to the locations of corner points. Section boundaries impacted are shown in red on the map and areas where quarter section divisions were impacted are shown in gray.</p>

GCDB v2.0, as provided to UGRC by the Utah state office of the BLM, can be downloaded in the CADNSDI data format and conforms to the newest Federal Geographic Data Committee (FGDC) guidelines for geospatial data. The CADNSDI data format is the first download option on this <a href="/products/sgid/cadastre/plss"><strong>web page</strong></a>. </p>
<p>UGRC is also providing derivative versions of GCDB v2.0 that attempt to enhance the usability of this data and correct for a small number of known errors in the latest release. UGRC derived GIS layers that have been updated in the SGID are:</p>

<p>While GCDB v2.0 improves the PLSS GIS representation, there's still significant work to be accomplished. A partial list of process enhancements, that would greatly improve the product and its applications, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Incorporation of the sizable collection of control points collected by local surveying efforts into the PLSS. Currently, this set of control points is published by UGRC (SGID.Cadastre.PLSSPoint_AGRC) has only been incorporated into the areas of interest identified by the BLM. An estimated 11,000 surveyed points have yet to be utilized within the current PLSS release.</li>
<li>Elimination of so-called 'nuisance adjustments' by placing position hold restraints on corners that have been well-established or where adjustments are of negligible amounts.</li>
<li>An accessible statewide system for logging and tracking of data enhancement and correction requests.</li>
<li>Closer integration of the digital collection of surveyor tie-sheet coordinates for corner point surveys and adjustments of the PLSS 'fabric'.</li>
<li>Closer integration of the PLSS adjustment and publishing process and the State's ongoing maintenance efforts for GIS map data layer of public lands ownership and administrative jurisdiction.</li>
</ul>
