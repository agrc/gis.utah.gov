Recently UGRC made some changes to the services available from our cloud server Discover (discover.agrc.utah.gov).
To see these new enhancements you may need to _refresh_ the connection you use to access Discover. ArcMap users can
right-click your connection to Discover in ArcCatalog and select `Refresh`. You might also want to clear your local cache.
ArcMap users can go to the serviceâ€™s `Layer Properties -> Cache` tab and select `Clear Local Cache Now`. Be patient
as this could take several minutes. Another option is to completely clear your ArcMap cache by going
to `Customize -> ArcMap Options -> Display Cache -> Clear Cache`.

The service additions and changes are listed below. We also renamed most of the services. {% include fa_icon.html exclamation=true class="svg-inline--fa fa-w-18" %} **The renaming of the services should not have any effect on projects or applications that contained any of the services previous to the renaming.** The renaming is on the layer's display title only and does not have any effect on the urls or request parameters for the service.

- **Utah** (licensed) - This service is now a mix of the most recent NAIP 1-meter and Google 6-inch imagery. The service
  now utilizes scale dependent rendering to display the color balanced NAIP imagery down to cache level 16,
  then renders the Google imagery at level 17 (starting at approx. 1:6,500) and down to level 20.
- **Google** (licensed) - This new service is the replacement for the old **utah** service and has the
  most recent Google imagery for Utah.
- **Basemap-Hybrid** (licensed) - This new service was created for convenience and performance for a dynamic mash-up of vector features with a transparent background from the **Basemap-Overlay** and the **Utah** imagery service.

More information about the services from Discover can be found on the page [Using SGID Base Map & Imagery Services in ArcMap](/documentation/discover).
