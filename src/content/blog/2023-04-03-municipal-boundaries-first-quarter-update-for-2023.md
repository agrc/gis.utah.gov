We begin 2023 with many cities jumping out to get a head start on the year with multiple annexation for them. Heber City led the way with four in three months. This put the state off to a good start for the year with 22 annexations already. These numbers are back to the pre-covid numbers when we were expanding state wide. Weâ€™ll have to wait and see if the trend continues.

If you are interested in your cities growth, check out all the changes and make sure your boundaries are where you think they should be, view them on the [Utah Municipality Modifications map](https://www.arcgis.com/home/webmap/viewer.html?webmap=c5ab7e0fcd514f1a9db6b8dad55bba63). To review any specific annexation document, go to the [Utah Lt. Governor Municipal Certifications](https://demosite.utah.gov/gov-entity/boundary-certifications-by-year/) website. This website is in a transition phase so it may change in the future.

The following table shows the changes and annexations (listed by county and city) since January 1, 2023:
