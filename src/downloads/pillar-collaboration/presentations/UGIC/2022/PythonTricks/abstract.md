## Abstract

You've learned the basics of python programming and you've got a couple scripts under your belt. You've wowed your boss by automating processes that used to take hours, and come up with magic numbers that explain everything.

Now that you've made the world a better place with programming, how would you like to make your programming world a better place too? We'll cover several useful tools that will improve your code and your programming process. Rather than going deep on each tool, we'll do a brief tour of all of them and point you to resources to learn more.

We'll start with a full-featured and extensible IDE, which is like that tricked-out workbench or fully-loaded tool chest you've always wanted. Code linters and formatters help keep your code consistently formatted and easy to read. Version control with git allows you to experiment and update freely without fear of losing previous versions that you know work. Putting your git repositories in GitHub opens up a world of collaboration and project management tools. Finally, unit testing allows you to make sure your code works as expected and can improve your program design.

## Bio

For three years I've been writing scripts to solve problems and automate processes for UGRC and our sister state agencies. I've been working with Python in a limited capacity since 2013 and in a GIS context for the last five years. I've also worked at Cache County and Taylorsville City, getting a sampling of different organization scopes and needs.
