  The demand for geospatial and location based information has increased dramatically as many disciplines realize the
  power of spatial data. A customer's address stored in a database has only so many uses. With this API, the door opens
  to many spatial opportunities from visually seeing customer locations on a map to being able to spatially analyze
  their relationship or patterns in conjunction with other events such as disease occurrences, natural disaster affected
  areas, and other location based occurrences. This API's two main endpoints allow you to geocode and search SGID data.

  Geocoding allows you to find a geographic location (i.e., the geographical coordinates) from an address. UGRC's
  geocoding philosophy is unique in that we would rather give you no match than the wrong match. But we assure you: we
  will have the best match rates for Utah addresses. How can we be so sure?â€”Because we're the experts in Utah geospatial
  data.

  Searching allows you to explore more than 1,000,000 rows of spatial SGID data. With over 300 layers of real-world data
  that you can run queries against in the SGID, the possibilities can be a little overwhelming. But the searching
  endpoint really opens up the opportunity for serious information gathering. You need a way to sift through all that
  information and make sense of it and our search endpoint can help you do that.
