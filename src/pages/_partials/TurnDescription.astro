  The Utah Reference Network (TURN) is a high-precision global navigation satellite system (GNSS) reference network
  providing real-time corrections and data for post processing. Our network consists of permanently located GPS
  receivers installed across Utah and portions of Idaho, Wyoming, and southern Nevada that generate real-time,
  high-accuracy GNSS positioning. These receivers send their data using the Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet
  Protocol (NTRIP) to a central system that analyzes the input to adjust and correct the data to provide the most
  accurate locations, usually down to centimeter level. Our network uses the Trimble Pivot VRS Platform.
