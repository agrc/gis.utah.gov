      Discover serves raster data (raster base maps and aerial imagery) as web services using the <ExternalLink
        href="https://www.ogc.org/standard/wms/">WMS</ExternalLink

      We have two different levels of access to Discover: general and licensed. General access is available to anyone
      and includes all our base maps and our publicly-available imagery (including the NAIP imagery). These services are
      only subject to our standard <a href="/documentation/policy/license/">data license and disclaimer</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our high-resolution imagery is provided by third parties and we are subject to their licensing requirements. Only
      entities associated with the state as defined in the <a href="/documentation/discover/licensed-imagery"
        >license details</a
      >
      may access these layers.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you register for either general or licensed access, you will receive a set of links for the services. These
      links contain a "quad-word" that is unique to your organization. This allows us to analyze usage trends and
      disable licensed links that are compromised.
    </p>
    <p>
      You are welcome to share your links within your organization-there's no need for individual users to register
      separately. However, do not share your links outside of your organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      Licensed links may not be used in publicly-available applications or services without being locked down to the
      application's domain. Please contact us if you need to get a set of locked-down links. We will disable any
      "wide-open" licensed links that are being used in publicly-available applications.

      While WMS and WMTS both return raster data that your client renders as a map layer, there are some key differences
      that make WMTS the better choice. Almost all modern clients support WMTS; generally, you should only use WMS if
      your software does not support WMTS.
    </p>
    <p>
      WMS renders each request on the server according to the spatial extent requested by the client, using the server's
      resources to render a single, custom image for each request. While this results in a custom render for every zoom
      level, each pan and zoom queries a new request and a new render. In addition, to keep the server from being
      overwhelmed, WMS requests are often limited to a maximum number of pixels, which can cause problems when exporting
      or printing at large sizes or resolutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      In contrast, WMTS serves a pre-rendered set of tiles that cover the requested extent. This results in much faster
      performance and unlimited export and print capabilities. However, these tiles are only pre-rendered at the <ExternalLink
        href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/product/mapping/web-map-zoom-levels-updated/"
        >common zoom scales</ExternalLink
      >, so the client must interpolate between these levels to render the map at custom scales, resulting in
      interpolation artifacts.

      If you need local access to our aerial imagery, check out <ExternalLink href="https://raster.utah.gov/"
        >raster.utah.gov</ExternalLink
      >, where you can download individual NAIP tiles or full county mosaics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Licensed users can use their Web Viewer and Download link to download individual Hexagon or Google imagery tiles.
      If you need a larger area, please contact us and we'll either help you set up a python script to download the
      tiles or arrange a way to transfer the data via hard drive.
