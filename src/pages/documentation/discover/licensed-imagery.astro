  <Section title="What is the High-Resolution Imagery?" stripe>
    <p>
      At the beginning of 2015, a coalition of state, regional, and local government agencies purchased a license to Google's state-wide, high-resolution (6-inch pixels) aerial photography as part of the state's on-going efforts to provide affordable high-resolution imagery. Google regularly updated the urban areas over the next few years, but some rural areas of the state were left with years-old imagery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Google announced that they would no longer be offering their imagery after 2018, so we started searching for other vendors. After evaluating all our options and financial resources, we selected Hexagon Geospatial and their high-resolution imagery. Their 2021 imagery provides 15cm (~6 inch) coverage of the entire state, and we are anticipating a delivery of new updated imagery in 2024.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will continue to provide the previously acquired imagery from the Google contract via the various "Google" services on Discover.
    </p>

  <Section title="The license">
    <p>
      The licenses governing both the Google and Hexagon imagery are very similar. They allow <strong>Utah's cities, counties, special districts, state agencies, school districts, colleges/universities, and tribes</strong> to use the imagery in web and desktop mapping applications either from our streaming web service or from locally-stored files. <strong>Contractors and formal partners of the immediate licensees</strong> are also allowed to use the imagery.
