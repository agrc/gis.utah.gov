      Our GPS network is a high-precision global navigation satellite system that provides real-time, high-accuracy GPS
      positioning. This central system analyzes the input and adjusts and corrects the data to provide the most accurate
      locations, usually down to centimeter level. Our networks use the Trimble PIVOT VRS Platform.
