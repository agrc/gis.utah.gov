      Our state-wide parcel boundary dataset is the most-visited data page on our website, and for good reason: property
      boundaries (even their rough, un-surveyed approximations in GIS) are a foundational layer for many maps. They
      facilitate both commercial activity and private property management.
    </p>
    <p>
      This statewide collection would not be possible without the cooperation of counties across the state who send us
      updates to their parcel data on a regular basis. We merge them into a single, consistent hosted dataset available
      to anyone for free.

      We are fortunate to have the luxury of free, up-to-date, and comprehensive road data. Thanks to the contributions
      of cities, counties, and UDOT, cartographers and analysts don't need to download road data from five different
      places with five different schemas, nor do they need to pay a commercial company to access data their tax dollars
      have already paid for. It's all here in one hosted dataset.

      The Utah Geological Survey has also spearheaded the monumental task of scanning and roughly locating all the
      historic imagery they could find. These scans give a glimpse into the past and are useful to track changes in land
      use over time. We help make them discoverable by sharing the link to their interactive map in the <a
        href="/products/sgid/sgid-index">SGID Index</a
      >.

      Sometimes a project needs a 10,000-foot overview of land ownership, especially in Utah where large amounts of land
      are owned by private individuals, the state, and the federal government. Utah has tasked the State Institutional
      Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) with maintaining a state-wide land ownership layer as part of their
      responsibilities, which they share on their <ExternalLink href="https://trustlands.utah.gov/resources/maps/"
        >website</ExternalLink
      >. Because this is such an important and fundamental dataset, SITLA also shares the data with the Open SGID and
      the SGID Open Data site for easy access to all.

    <p>
      A key part of the land development process is identifying any natural hazards that may impact a project. In the
      past, we have hosted the Utah Geological Survey's natural hazard layers in the precursor to the Open SGID
      database. However, it became a burden to maintain a separate copy of their data as they constantly update their
      internal data with newly mapped areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      To improve access, we've worked with UGS to replace their Open SGID layers with their ArcGIS Online feature
      services available through the <ExternalLink href="https://opendata.gis.utah.gov">SGID on ArcGIS</ExternalLink>.
      This sharing method ensures there is only one copy of the data and updates are immediately available.

      Some collaborations take the form of support for UGRC-created hosted datasets. For example, under the direction of
      the Lieutenant Governor's office, we map all the changes to city boundaries from annexations, incorporations, and
      disconnections to create a statewide municipal boundary dataset. We also coordinate among various state and
      federal agencies to collect Lidar data for as much of the state as possible. Finally, with the support of the
      state legislature and cities and counties across the state, we spearhead the acquisition of state-wide,
      high-resolution aerial imagery.
