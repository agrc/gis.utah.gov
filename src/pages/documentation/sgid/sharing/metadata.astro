    <p>
      An essential part of sharing data is helping people understand what it is and where it came from. We want to make
      the process more conversational. In other words, instead of looking at a long list of metadata requirements, we
      thought it would be easier to talk about the data.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have distilled the basic elements of metadata into a few approachable questions (which match our general
      metadata requirements). If you can answer these simple questions about your data, then you're officially on your
      way to good metadata. If you contribute data to Utah's State Geographic Information Datasource, we encourage you
      to use our <ExternalLink
        href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJSV935GTN3djtErkBdeXkumuZvd10z2805It1-eFn0Mlo9w/viewform?usp=sf_link"
        >metadata form</ExternalLink
      >. It's a great way to update your metadata and make it more discoverable. The form covers all the questions above
      and—best of all—after you submit your responses, your portion of the process is done! UGRC, in collaboration with
      the DTS editor, will handle the remaining details.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can add your answers to these questions straight into the basic metadata elements. It's as simple as answering
      a few questions, transferring your responses, and then you have informative, standardized metadata.
    </p>
    <p>
      These questions are designed to work with the ESRI <ExternalLink

    <h3>What is this dataset?</h3>
    <p>
      You are most likely very familiar with the data and the terms used to name the data. Not everyone else will be.
      Describe the data as if you were explaining it to a naive person.
    </p>
    <h3>What is its purpose?</h3>
    <p>This helps answer the questions of why was the data created and how can it be used.</p>
  </Section>
  <Section {...page.section[2]}>
    <h3>What does this dataset represent?</h3>
    <p>e.g.: Road centerlines represent physical roads</p>

    <h3>How was it created?</h3>
    <p>e.g.: Digitized, GPS, etc.</p>

    <h3>How reliable and accurate is it?</h3>
    <p>e.g.: Survey-grade, mapping-grade, crayon-grade, etc.</p>

    <h3>What is its general update schedule?</h3>
    <p>e.g.: Monthly, yearly, as needed, etc.</p>

    <h3>Are there any warnings or limitations on the data?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>e.g.: Don’t use parcels as a legal boundary depiction</li>
      <li>e.g.: Don’t use parcels as a complete dataset for geocoding</li>
      <li>e.g.: Don’t use zip codes for demographic generalization</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Are there any common misconceptions or assumptions about these data that should be further explained?</h3>
    <p>
      e.g.: Highway milepost markers are not an accurate length measurement. If a highway is lengthened or shortened,
      the markers are not adjusted.
    </p>
  </Section>
  <Section {...page.section[3]}>
    <h3>Who created this dataset?</h3>
    <p>This can create confidence that an authoritative entity created and maintains the data.</p>
    <h3>What is the best point of contact?</h3>
    <p>If someone had further questions or would like to get involved, who should they contact?</p>
