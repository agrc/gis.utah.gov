      Sharing with the SGID can be a great way to make your data more accessible to the public. All of our sharing
      methods start with an <ExternalLink href="https://guides.github.com/features/issues/">issue</ExternalLink> in our <ExternalLink
        href="https://github.com/agrc/porter/issues">Porter</ExternalLink
      > repository on GitHub. This allows everyone a chance to follow along with a dataset's progress in the submission process
      and to keep an open and transparent record of everything that happened. We also run some checks with <ExternalLink
        href="https://github.com/agrc/sweeper">Sweeper</ExternalLink
      >
      and check that the metadata
      <a href="/documentation/sgid/sharing/metadata">meets our minimum standards</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've compiled a page of highlights showing the importance of collaboration to hopefully give you the nudge to
      share with the SGID.
    </p>
  </Section>
  <Section {...page.section[1]}>
    <p>
      The simplest way to share your data is by adding links for existing, qualifying data (what we call "external
      data") to the SGID Index, which aims to be a database of all statewide GIS resources. If you are hosting GIS
      resources on your own server, we can link to your datasets in the SGID Index.
    </p>
    <h3>Sharing with the SGID Index</h3>
    <p>
      First <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/agrc/porter/issues/new/choose">submit an issue</ExternalLink> in Porter
      using the <code>Add external data links to the SGID Index</code> template. Fill out the <code>Summary</code> information
      and check the relevant box in the <code>Submitter's Process</code> section.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will review your submission against the qualifications and reach out with any questions. You can track this in
      the <code>UGRC's Process</code> section of the issue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once we've worked together to resolve any questions or problems, we'll add your dataset to the SGID Index and
      close the issue.
    </p>

  <Section {...page.section[2]}>
    <p>
      We use Esri's Hub product to offer the SGID on ArcGIS. A centralized list of ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Enterprise
      Portal services are available through <a href="https://opendata.gis.utah.gov">opendata.gis.utah.gov</a>. This is a
      great way to use your existing ArcGIS Online or Enterprise infrastructure to share your data with little
      additional work. We are happy to include any datasets in the SGID on ArcGIS site that meet our qualifications.
      Just like the SGID Index, AGOL items hosted in your organization are considered "external data."
    </p>
    <h3>Sharing with the SGID on ArcGIS</h3>
    <p>
      ArcGIS Online items are added to the SGID on ArcGIS by sharing them with one of our SGID groups in ArcGIS Online.
      This process gives both you and UGRC a chance to review the quality of the item before it is shared. We reserve
      the right to remove items from SGID on ArcGIS if they don't go through this process.
    </p>
    <p>SGID on ArcGIS relies on information from the source ArcGIS Online item:</p>
    <Image src={openDataAnnotationPhoto} alt="An annotated Open Data item screenshot" class="w-full" />
    <p>As noted in the qualifications, make sure the following items are taken care of:</p>
    <BulletedList>
      <li>The ArcGIS Online item is publicly shared</li>
      <li>The item has a good title, description, and tags</li>
      <li>
        The <code>Allow others to export data to different formats</code> in the <code>Settings</code> tab is enabled (if
        possible)
      </li>
      <li>The <code>source</code> value should be set using the method described below</li>
    </BulletedList>
    <p>
      ArcGIS Hub displays the <code>source</code> value on each item and uses it to sort search results. It's very important
      for every organization to have a single, unified <code>source</code>. Esri explains where this value comes from <ExternalLink
        href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/hub/get-started/frequently-asked-questions.htm#anchor10"
        >in this FAQ</ExternalLink
      >. To summarize, it first searches the ArcGIS Online item's metadata for an organization name. If it doesn't find
      anything there, it falls back to your ArcGIS organization name.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you want to customize the name displayed, we suggest setting it in the <code
        >Resource &gt; Citation &gt; Contact &gt; Organization Name</code
      > metadata field. Otherwise, leave the metadata contact fields empty and it will use your ArcGIS Online organization
      name. We use this second way to show <code>Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC)</code> as the source for
      all our datasets. You may need to remove any values in the metadata contact fields if you want to use your default
      organization name.
    </p>
    <p>
      To edit the organization name in the ArcGIS Online item's metadata, you need to make sure your ArcGIS Online
      organization has <ExternalLink
        href="https://doc.arcgis.com/en/arcgis-online/administer/configure-details.htm#ESRI_SECTION1_7FE1F060E03046E692BB36E5F6E3B2AE"
        >metadata enabled</ExternalLink
      >. Then you can use the Metadata editor on the ArcGIS Online item page to set either field.
    </p>
    <Image
      src={openDataMetadataPhoto}
      alt="Organization name sources in ArcGIS Online metadata screenshot"
      class="w-full"
    />
    <p>
      There are a couple of things to check before and after you upload or overwrite your ArcGIS Online items. A common
      disruptive issue has to do with feature service index ids changing. If you overwrite a feature service, the index
      id can change if the data is in a different position in the map table of contents at publish time. This creates a
      new URL to the service breaking all maps and apps that use the feature service. We suggest having a publishing
      ArcGIS Pro project that only contains the publishing layer with it's index set to 0 (which is the default).
    </p>
    <p>
      The way you upload or overwrite your ArcGIS Online data may also overwrite the item's metadata with info from the
      local source's metadata. We suggest you make any changes in both the feature class and ArcGIS Online metadata to
      avoid problems in the future. In the FGDC CSDGM metadata style, the <code
        >Resource &gt; Citation &gt; Contact &gt; Organization Name</code
      > field is in <code>Overview &gt; Citation Contacts</code>. The <code
        >Resource &gt; Contact &gt; Organization Name</code
      > field is in <code>Resource &gt; Points of Contact</code>.
    </p>

      The Open SGID is a curated, publicly-accessible database of statewide GIS layersâ€”the latest evolution of the
      traditional "SGID as a single geospatial database" model. We are excited to offer a direct connection to everyone
      once again.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have a statewide dataset but don't have the ability to host or share it yourself, we may host it in the
      Open SGID if it meets our qualifications. We also share most Open SGID layers through <a
        href="https://opendata.gis.utah.gov">opendata.gis.utah.gov</a
      > (by first uploading it as a feature service in our ArcGIS Online <a href="https://utah.maps.arcgis.com"
        >organization</a
      >). Unsurprisingly, we refer to these datasets as "hosted data."
    </p>
    <p>
      Maintaining data in the Open SGID requires the most work, both on the front end and for long-term maintenance. We
      encourage you to share your data via SGID on ArcGIS or the SGID Index whenever possible. However, in order to
      maintain consistency and familiarity with previous versions of the SGID geodatabase, we may include some datasets
      in the Open SGID that are otherwise better suited for SGID on ArcGIS or the SGID Index. This is done at our
      discretion according to our policies.
    </p>
    <h3>Sharing with the Open SGID</h3>
    <p>
      If you would like to share data with the Open SGID, we will work with you to create a pipeline to identify when
      and how we'll access and receive updates to the data. We'll run data checks and reviews with <ExternalLink
        href="https://github.com/agrc/sweeper">Sweeper</ExternalLink
      > on the data to ensure high quality and share that feedback with you. Fixing the issues in the source will help streamline
      any future data updates, but isn't necessary to submit the data for the Open SGID. We'll still happily add it to the
      Open SGID after fixing any issues on our local copy with Sweeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before submitting your data, make sure it has a stable schema and is ready for public consumption. Any future
      schema changes could be a breaking change that would disrupt users of the data. Make sure the metadata meets our
      minimum standards. If you need help with metadata, check out our basic metadata creation process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Start thinking about the futureâ€”how often will this dataset be updated? How can we automate the updates?
      Sometimes, old data is worse than no data at all. If a user can't find anything, they still know what they don't
      know. But if they find outdated data without realizing it, they may not know that they are acting on outdated
      information.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once you've have a chance to think about the above concerns, <ExternalLink
        href="https://github.com/agrc/porter/issues/new/choose">submit an issue</ExternalLink
      > in Porter using the <code>Add data to Open SGID</code> template. Fill out the <code>Summary</code> information and
      check the relevant boxes in the <code>Submitter's Process</code> section.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will review your submission against the qualifications and reach out with any questions. You can track this in
      the <code>UGRC's Process</code> section of the issue.
    </p>
    <p>Once we've worked together to resolve any questions or problems, we'll add it to the Open SGID.</p>
