    <h3>License attribution</h3>
    <p>
      You should include <strong>appropriate attribution</strong> when using data or services provided by UGRC in your maps,
      web applications, or other content. This includes providing credit to UGRC and indicating if you made any changes to
      the data. We may consider exceptions to this requirement on a case-by-case basis.
    </p>
    <p>
      For referenced data hosted by other organizations (such as data from the Utah Geological Survey), please contact
      the owner for attribution guidelines.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Detailed references</strong> in a paper or book should follow your particular style guide. Please include the
      last updated date if it is available in the metadata or the date you accessed/downloaded the data if not. For example,
      this is what it could look like in an MLA-esque format:

      and a note of any changes made to the data. They should also include the disclaimer below and relevant metadata as
      outlined in our
      <a href="/documentation/policy/metadata/">metadata policy</a>. The dataset's description could include the
      following line:

      disclaimer. However, we are not lawyers. Please work with your own legal counsel before adopting a disclaimer. Any
      republished UGRC data should include this disclaimer in it's unmodified form.
