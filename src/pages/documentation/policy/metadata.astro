      Effective metadata helps people understand the source of a dataset, how up-to-date it is, and any of its inherent
      restrictions or limitations. Listed below are the minimum metadata items that should be present in any SGID
      datasets. These correspond to the Esri <ExternalLink
        href="https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/latest/help/metadata/view-and-edit-metadata.htm"
        >Item Description</ExternalLink
      > metadata style and the metadata displayed on an item's ArcGIS Online page.
    </p>
  </Section>
  <Section {...page.section[1]}>
    <p>
      The title should match the dataset name. If it's a statewide dataset, the title should begin with the word
      &quot;Utah&quot;.
    </p>
    <p>Example: <code>Utah County Boundaries</code></p>
  </Section>
  <Section {...page.section[2]}>
    <p>
      Tags are used by ArcGIS Online in its search algorithms and can be used in Open Data to group data. At a minimum,
      each SGID dataset's tags should include the stewarding agency (ie: UGRC), &quot;SGID&quot;, and the appropriate
      category name. We also recommend adding any additional, relevant tags that might help with data discoverability.
      However, there is no need to include words that are contained in the layer's title (these will be omitted).
    </p>
    <p>
      All words in tags should be title-cased except for articles (“of”, “the”, “and”, etc.) or abbreviations. Each tag
      should be separated by a comma. Please refer to <ExternalLink
        href="https://www.esri.com/arcgis-blog/products/arcgis-online/data-management/using-tags-effectively/"
        >Using tags effectively</ExternalLink
      > for more ideas and information.
    </p>
    <p>Example: <code>UGRC, SGID, Recreation, Paths, Biking, Hiking, Horseback Riding</code></p>
  </Section>
  <Section {...page.section[3]}>
    <p>
      The description is a more in-depth version of the summary and should stand on its own. It is a great place for
      details on the source of the data, how frequently it's updated, its usability at certain scales, or any common
      misconceptions. A good description is also important because it's the main info displayed in the <ExternalLink
        href="https://opendata.gis.utah.gov/">SGID on ArcGIS</ExternalLink
      > (the summary is not shown).
    </p>
    <p>
      The first line of the description should be the date the dataset was last updated so people have a clear and
      consistent place to see how fresh or stale it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      For datasets hosted by UGRC, this section should also contain a link to the corresponding <ExternalLink
        href="/products/sgid/categories">gis.utah.gov data page</ExternalLink
      >.
    </p>
  </Section>
  <Section {...page.section[4]}>
    <p>The credits should clearly state who created the dataset and how you can get in contact with them.</p>
    <p>Example: <code>UGRC, UDOT</code></p>
  </Section>
  <Section {...page.section[5]}>
    <p>
      This section includes both usage limitations (any constraints on where or how the dataset can be used, including
      disclaimers and attribution rules) and the intellectual property license (if any) associated with the dataset
      (like Creative Commons).
    </p>
    <p>
      We use <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/agrc/sweeper">Sweeper</ExternalLink> to automatically populate our hosted
      datasets with our standard <a href="/documentation/policy/license">disclaimer</a> and <a
        href="/documentation/policy/license">license</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open Data will try to find references to the common licenses and will link to the appropriate license. Otherwise,
      it just lists &quot;Custom License&quot; and displays the item's Terms of Use text.
