    UGRC loves students! We want to help you get the best education you can. We've got a host of resources that can help you with class projects, personal exploration, and preparing for life after school. Have you made something cool? <a href="https://twitter.com/MapUtah">Tweet</a> us about it, we'd love to hear!

    > Data! Data! Data! I can't make bricks without clay! - Sherlock Holmes

    Do you need road data to build a network dataset? What about a high-resolution DEM for a suitability analysis? Or school locations for a demographic study?

    The <a href="/products/sgid/">State Geospatial Information Datasource</a> has a large <a href="/products/sgid-index/">catalog</a> of freely-available data you can use in your classwork, projects, or personal tinkering.

    You can connect directly to the <a href="/products/open-sgid/">Open SGID</a> in your GIS software or access downloads and Esri web feature services through our <a href="https://opendata.gis.utah.gov">SGID Hub</a>. You can download our raster data (aerial imagery, DEMs, etc.) at https://raster.utah.gov.

    Does your research project have you counting trees in aerial imagery? Or do you have data ready to map and just need a clean canvas to put it on? Our <a href="/products/discover/">Discover</a> base map and imagery web services provide access to both aerial imagery and our set of gorgeous <a href="/data/base-maps/">base maps</a> that you can use in both static and web maps.

    Students and faculty of Utah-funded schools can sign up for licensed access to Discover, which includes the high-res imagery we've purchased for the State of Utah along with our base maps.

    And don't worry, out-of-statersâ€”we love you too! Anyone can sign up for general access to use our gorgeous base maps and the latest NAIP imagery.

    Get your name out there! UGRC sponsors and helps out with many different GIS events throughout the year and is actively involved with the <a href="https://ugic.org/">Utah Geographic Information Council</a> (UGIC), the state's GIS community. Be sure to sign up for their newsletter!

    <a href="https://ugic.org/maps-on-the-hill/">Maps on the Hill</a> is a great opportunity to showcase your work at the State Capitol during the legislative session and rub shoulders with fellow map geeks. The annual <a href="https://ugic.org/ugic-annual-conference/">UGIC conference</a> in May is loaded with great sessions, and student presentations are always welcome!

    There are also local <a href="/collaboration/user-groups/">GIS user groups</a> that meet throughout the year. These meetings are great opportunities to network and learn from other GIS professionals.

    GIS is useful in a broad spectrum of industries, and jobs and positions come available throughout the year. Be sure to sign up for the <a href="https://ugic.org/about-2/sign-up-for-our-email-list/">UGIC mailing list</a> to stay up-to-date on the latest local (and often regional) openings. Whenever we have an opening here at UGRC, we post it to the UGIC list. Local user groups often have their own mailing lists as well.
