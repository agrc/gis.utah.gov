    `Data! Data! Data! I can't make bricks without clay!` - Sherlock Holmes

    The <a href="/products/sgid/">State Geospatial Information Datasource</a> has a large <a href="/products/sgid-index/">catalog</a> of freely-available data you can use in your classwork, projects, or personal tinkering.

    You can connect directly to the <a href="/products/open-sgid/">Open SGID</a> in your GIS software or access downloads and Esri web feature services through our <a href="https://opendata.gis.utah.gov">SGID Hub</a>.

  <Section title="Basemaps and Imagery">

    Need high-res imagery for a research project? Students and faculty of Utah-funded schools can sign up for licensed access to <a href="/products/discover/">Discover</a>, our basemaps and imagery web services.

    And don't worry, out-of-statersâ€”we love you too! Anyone can sign up for general access to use our gorgeous basemaps and the latest NAIP imagery.

  <Section stripe title="Conferences and Events">

    Get your name out there! UGRC sponsors and helps out with many different GIS events throughout the year and is actively involved with the <a href="https://ugic.org/">Utah Geographic Information Council</a> (UGIC), the state's GIS community. Be sure to sign up for their newsletter!

    <a href="https://ugic.org/maps-on-the-hill/">Maps on the Hill</a> is a great opportunity to showcase your work at the State Capitol during the legislative session and rub shoulders with fellow map geeks. The annual <a href="https://ugic.org/ugic-annual-conference/">UGIC conference</a> in May is loaded with great sessions, and student presentations are always welcome!

    There are also local <a href="/collaboration/user-groups/">GIS user groups</a> that meet throughout the year. These meetings are great opportunties to network and learn from other GIS professionals.

  <Section title="Jobs and Internships">

    GIS is useful in a broad spectrum of industries, and jobs and positions come available throughout the year. Be sure to sign up for the <a href="https://ugic.org/about-2/sign-up-for-our-email-list/">UGIC mailing list</a> to stay up-to-date on the latest local (and often regional) openings. Whenever we have an opening here at UGRC, we post it to the UGIC list. Local user groups often have their own mailing lists as well.
