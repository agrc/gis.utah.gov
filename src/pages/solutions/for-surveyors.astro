      Led by UGRC's State Surveyor, the Monument Replacement and Restoration Committee (MRRC) coordinates efforts to
      identify, replace, and restore survey monuments, which serve as the cornerstone for accurate land surveys. The
      MRRC administers an annual grant program aimed at assisting counties with improving their inventory of monuments
      by providing funds for the location and replacement of these historical markers, helping ensure the continued
      accuracy and reliability of property boundaries for surveyors and landowners alike. <a href="/contact/"
