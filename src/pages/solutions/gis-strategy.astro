      The best time to develop a strategy for incorporating spatial thinking into the business is the moment that
      business begins asking questions involving “where”. Where is everything from ‘Where do we locate our office?’, to
      ‘Where are our customers?’ or ‘Where are needs being unmet or underserved?’. Having some clear goals and
      expectations will help in right sizing the investment in GIS - from a consumer to an enterprise contributor. You
      don’t need to see into the distant future, however you should have some clearly defined agency goals that you are
      trying to achieve, then investigate <strong>where</strong> GIS can help to achieve those goals.

      Forget fancy maps and data visualizations – the real key to unlocking the power of location data for your
      organization is getting someone, a champion, on board who understands its value. Find a champion who sees the
      potential of using location information to improve decision-making.

      Together, you can explore how to integrate this type of analysis into your everyday work processes to solve real
      problems. Even a simple map showing the current situation can be very helpful. But the real power comes from
      seeing how things change over time and location. This can reveal hidden patterns that can lead to better choices
      across the company.

      Does your data contain a street address, a zip code or something that could be considered a location or boundary?
      If so, then ensuring that the spatial component of your data is suitable for analysis is a critical step in the
      development of an overall business strategy regarding spatial data. Get in touch with us if you need help with
      this aspect of your data.
