    <p>
      Every second counts in an emergency. Accurate and precise GIS data is the backbone for a swift and effective 911
      response. That is where the Utah Geospatial Resource Center (UGRC) comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      UGRC empowers Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) by providing access to a comprehensive suite of accurate and
      up-to-date geospatial data. This includes vital infrastructure layers such as service area boundaries and civic
      location data. With this data, PSAPs can pinpoint caller location, ensuring emergency responders are dispatched to
      the appropriate scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      UGRC goes beyond data provision, offering technical assistance and fostering collaboration between PSAPs. By
      ensuring all players have access to the same high-quality GIS data, UGRC plays a critical role in streamlining
      emergency response and potentially saving lives.

    <p>
      Service area boundaries are required data layers for PSAPs and dispatch centers and include EMS, fire, and law.
    </p>
    <p>
      These boundaries define the specific geographic areas each emergency service agency is responsible for. This
      allows dispatchers to quickly identify the most appropriate agency to respond to an incident based on its
      location. Dispatching the closest and most qualified unit saves valuable time and ensures resources are used
      efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      UGRC maintains statewide geographic data layers for each the required service area boundaries. These layers are
      updated on a monthly basis and are actively used in the state's Next Generation 911 (NG911) call routing system.
    </p>
