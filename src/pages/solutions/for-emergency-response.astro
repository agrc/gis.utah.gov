      Every second counts in an emergency. Accurate and precise GIS data is the backbone for a swift and effective 911
      response. That is where the Utah Geospatial Resource Center (UGRC) comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
      UGRC empowers Public Safety Answering Points (PSAPs) by providing access to a comprehensive suite of accurate and
      up-to-date geospatial data. This includes vital infrastructure layers such as service area boundaries and civic
      location data. With this data, PSAPs can pinpoint caller location, ensuring emergency responders are dispatched to
      the appropriate scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      UGRC goes beyond data provision, offering technical assistance and fostering collaboration between PSAPs. By
      ensuring all players have access to the same high-quality GIS data, UGRC plays a critical role in streamlining
      emergency response and potentially saving lives.

    <p>
      Service area boundaries are required data layers for <a
        href="/products/sgid/society/public-safety-answering-point-boundaries">PSAPs</a
      > and dispatch centers and include <a href="/products/sgid/society/emergency-medical-response-areas">EMS</a>, <a
        href="/products/sgid/society/fire-response-areas">fire</a
      >, and <a href="/products/sgid/society/law-enforcement-boundaries">law</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      These boundaries define the specific geographic areas each emergency service agency is responsible for. This
      allows dispatchers to quickly identify the most appropriate agency to respond to an incident based on its
      location. Dispatching the closest and most qualified unit saves valuable time and ensures resources are used
      efficiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      UGRC maintains statewide geographic data layers for each the required service area boundaries. These layers are
      updated on a monthly basis and are actively used in the state's Next Generation 911 (NG911) call routing system.

      When seconds matter, knowing the precise location of an emergency is critical. UGRC is as a trusted source for
      this vital data.
    </p>
    <p>
      UGRC provides a comprehensive library of authoritative, and up-to-date, civic location information, including
      precise <a href="/products/sgid/location/address-points">address points</a>, <a
        href="/products/sgid/transportation/road-centerlines">road centerlines</a
      >, and other crucial infrastructure layers like law enforcement locations (<a
        href="/products/sgid/society/law-enforcement-facilities">police</a
      > and <a href="/products/sgid/society/fire-stations">fire</a> stations), <a
        href="/products/sgid/health/healthcare-facilities">hospitals</a
      >, and <a href="/products/sgid/society/open-source-places">common places</a>. This granular data allows emergency
      dispatchers to pinpoint caller location with unmatched accuracy, ensuring first responders are directed to the
      exact scene without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, UGRC's commitment to data quality and accessibility empowers all emergency response agencies (PSAPs)
      across Utah to operate with standardized data. This collaborative approach fueled by accurate civic location data
      from UGRC can mean the difference between life and death in critical situations.

    <p>
      UGRC is the official Next-Generation-911 (NG911) geospatial data provider for the Utah statewide 911 system. We
      work closely with the Utah Communications Authority's (UCA) <ExternalLink
        href="https://www.uca911.org/911-division">911 Division</ExternalLink
      > to ensure that all 911 calls in Utah are routed to the appropriate PSAP.
    </p>
    <p>
      UGRC's NG911 Dataset provides the foundation to this system. The dataset adheres to the <ExternalLink
        href="https://www.nena.org/page/standards">National Emergency Number Association</ExternalLink
      > (NENA) standard. It includes the essential layers like road centerlines, address points, and PSAP, fire, and law
      boundaries. Additionally, the dataset incorporates many recommended layers, such as cell towers, county boundaries,
      hydrology lines (streams and lakes), incorporated municipalities, mile markers, railroads, state boundaries, and unincorporated
      communities. The primary source for the NG911 Dataset is the <a href="/products/sgid">SGID</a>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The NG911 Dataset is a great starting point for PSAPs wanting to explore what UGRC has to offer. It is updated
      monthly and can be downloaded as a file geodatabase.
