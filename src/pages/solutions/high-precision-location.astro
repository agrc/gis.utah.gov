    <p>
      Our Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) network consists of permanently located GPS receivers, installed
      across an area, that generates real-time, high-accuracy GPS positioning. All of our permanently installed GPS
      receivers send their data to a central system via the internet. This central system analyzes the input and adjusts
      and corrects the data to provide the most accurate locations, usually down to centimeter level. Our networks use
      the Trimble PIVOT VRS Platform. The generated data is sent from the GPS receiver to the GPS reference network
      through a wireless connection using the Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol (NTRIP).

      Our real-time GPS network plays a crucial role in keeping drones in designated flight corridors. This aids a
      multitude of services including critical medical deliveries.

      Navigation of driverless vehicles is greatly improved when using a real-time network versus a standard GPS
      network. Having a reliable network helps keep drivers safe by preventing collisions and keeping vehicles in the
      appropriate lane. <i>insert images of vehicle driving with standard GPS and real-time network</i>

      High-accuracy GNSS networks have been used in science and research to study and better understand the world around
      us. Our GNSS network can help support Disaster Response Management, agricultural and forestry, landslide
      monitoring, and more! This <ExternalLink

      A high-accuracy GNSS network plays a crucial role in meteorology and mitigating the effects of climate change.
      Real-time measurements can help improve weather predictions, severe weather monitoring, atmospheric modeling, and
      much more!
