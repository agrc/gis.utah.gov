      The Geographic Information Systems Advisory Council (GISAC) fulfills the need of a coordinating body for statewide
      geospatial efforts. Its implementation has waxed and waned over the years, yet it serves as an important forum for thought and action to affect meaningful change in the geospatial landscape of Utah by bringing various stakeholders together. For example in the 1990s the focus was Digital Ortho-photo quads, and road attributes. Later GISAC enabled
      joint efforts such as the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) with the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), the state of
      Utah and other interested parties.
