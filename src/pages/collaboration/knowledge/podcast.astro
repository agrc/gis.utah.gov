    description: `In this episode, we talk with Deidre Beck from the Utah Department of Environmental Quality.  Deidre works in the Division of Drinking Water as an Environmental Scientist.

This episode was recorded on January 25th, 2023, and concludes our three-part series on water here in Utah.  You can listen to all of our episodes, including the water series, wherever you find your podcast.

Deidre explains how her division has primacy over the Utah Safe Drinking Water Act.

Her division is also tasked with conducting regular sanitary surveys for every public water system in Utah - ensuring these systems meet water quality standards

She explains how Utah obtains much of its drinking water via surface water - and how important the Provo River is to drinking water along the Wasatch Front.

Deidre also explains the concept of ridgeline authority, which gives some of the larger cities (such as Salt Lake City) the right to establish ordinances in areas outside of their jurisdiction. This ridgeline authority allows them to protect public drinking water in these zones.

We also talk a bit about the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and how the Division of Drinking Water created a map to show disadvantaged areas, so the water suppliers in these areas can apply for hardship funding to improve the water systems there.

So, take a moment to sit back, and enjoy the show.`,

In Part one we focus on water resources. In Part two we discuss water rights,
and in part three we focus on drinking water.

You can find all of our episodes in our podcast feed or wherever you find your podcasts.

Today's show is part two in the water series and we’re talking with Lee Eschler from DNR’s Division of Water Rights.

Lee tells us how the PLSS section corners are a critical piece to water rights in Utah including the locating, purchasing, and the selling of these rights.

He also explains the current water rights situation for water in and around the Great Salt Lake and how there are no new water rights being granted on water that flows into the Lake

Then we discuss a bit on adjudication and how it gives the state a better understanding of what is and what is not being used and how this is an ongoing process

So sit back and take a moment to enjoy the show. `,

She also reminds us of what a datum is and what we need to know about the new datums that are coming in 2023. She also explains the GPS on BenchMark program and how you can contribute. We then ask her about her recent visit to Utah and the importance of the PLSS monument preservation at Temple Square and also the USGS/UGRC Great Salt Lake Causeway project - a project measuring water levels and height.`,
