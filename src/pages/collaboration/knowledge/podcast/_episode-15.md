**Greg Bunce:** Welcome to another episode of the Utah Geospatial Podcast. This is Greg Bunce.

**Matt Peters:** And I'm Matt Peters.

**Greg Bunce:** And we're from the Utah Geospatial Resource Center. This podcast will be bringing you Geospatial news from across Utah.

Today on the show we are talking to Matt Peters. Yes, that is my co-host, Matt Peters. In case you haven't heard the news, Matt will be retiring at the end of the year. He's been with the state for 30 years.

We thought we'd take this opportunity to talk about his career, the changes he's seen, and where he sees things going.

Also, I've asked our colleague, Sean Fernandez, the State Surveyor, to join us for the interview. So let's jump right in.

**Sean Fernandez:** So Matt, 30 years. That's a long time. Tell us how you got started.

**Matt Peters:** Well, I guess it started back in college. I was at the University of Utah studying Geography. I had a professor, Georgehepner, who really got me interested in GIS. Back then it was command line ARC/INFO. It was pretty rudimentary compared to what we have today.

I started as an intern with AGRC, which is now UGRC, back in 1993. And I just never left. I loved the work, I loved the people, and I loved the mission.

**Greg Bunce:** So Matt, what are some of the biggest changes you've seen over those 30 years?

**Matt Peters:** Oh wow. Where do I start? Obviously the technology has changed immensely. Going from command line to desktop to web-based GIS. The ability to share data and collaborate has just exploded.

But I think the biggest change has been the acceptance and understanding of GIS. Back when I started, we had to explain to everyone what GIS was and why they needed it. Now, it's just expected. People assume that there's a map for everything and that they can access data instantly.

**Sean Fernandez:** What are some of the projects you're most proud of?

**Matt Peters:** There are so many. But I think the SGID, the State Geographic Information Database, is probably the biggest one. Just the concept of having a centralized repository for geospatial data that everyone can use. It's really been the foundation for everything we do.

Also, the work we've done with 911. Helping to build the statewide dataset for Next Generation 911 has been a huge undertaking, but it's so important for public safety.

And then just the relationships we've built. Working with the counties, the cities, the state agencies. That collaboration is really what makes it all work.

**Greg Bunce:** So what's next for you Matt? What are you going to do in retirement?

**Matt Peters:** Well, as you mentioned in the intro, I'm an avid cyclist. So I plan to do a lot more riding. I want to travel. My wife and I have some trips planned. And just enjoy life. I'm sure I'll still keep an eye on what's happening in the geospatial world, but I'm looking forward to stepping back and letting the next generation take over.

**Sean Fernandez:** Well Matt, it's been a pleasure working with you. You've been a great mentor and friend.

**Greg Bunce:** Yeah Matt, we're going to miss you. But we're excited for you.

**Matt Peters:** Thanks guys. It's been a great ride. Pun intended.
