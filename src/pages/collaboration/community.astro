      Utah’s GIS user groups are valuable venues to obtain the latest information on technology, data, and projects.
      User groups are formed and managed by GIS practitioners in various regions throughout the state. They are great
      for meeting new Utah GIS community members, and connecting with longtime colleagues and friends. UGRC staff attend
      several user group meetings each year, when possible.

      UGIC is a nonprofit organization whose mission is to lead the effective application of geographic information in
      Utah. It is their vision to provide a modern, accurate, documented, and accessible geospatial information
      infrastructure for all of Utah. They contribute to and participate in many GIS events such as the annual Maps on
      the Hill (MOTH) (link to MOTH page/section?), local user group meetings (link to GIS User Groups page?), and GIS
      Day activities. The culminating UGIC event is an annual conference, typically held in one of Utah’s many unique
      sites or communities, to bring the whole Utah GIS community together. UGRC maintains an ongoing, appointed seat on
      the UGIC Board.

      NSGIC is a national organization that promotes the coordinated, impactful, and cost-efficient application of GIS
      and other location-based information and analytics to best serve the nation, with emphasis on the power of
      initiatives and public policy that connect across local, state, federal, and private sector partners. UGRC
      representatives attend bi-annual conferences, and participate in NSGIC initiatives. UGRC was an early member of
      the NSGIC organization, and has helped to develop national and state-level geospatial policies and guiding
      principles.

      UAC is a voluntary, statewide organization whose members are the 29 counties of Utah, with a purpose of improving
      the operation of county governments and, henceforth, the quality of services to their residents. The 29 counties
      within the State of Utah are special partners to UGRC. We greatly respect and rely on them for local knowledge,
      and the ongoing sharing of data that we aggregate and make available for many important statewide systems. UGRC
      staff often sponsor a booth and give presentations at annual UAC conferences.
