    <p>
      The SGID aims to be the primary source for state-wide GIS data in Utah by creating a single portal to datasets
      created by many different agencies and organizations. With such a broad scope, SGID datasets live in many
      different places depending on their type, availability, and popularity.

    <p>
      Discover is a cloud-based web service serving aerial imagery and base maps. These services are available in both
      WMTS and WMS formats from the Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) for broad compatibility and are provided in the Web
      Mercator WGS84 projection (wkid/EPSG 3857).
    </p>
    <p>Discover offers over 20 services that are free to use (however, a few require a signed license agreement).</p>

    <p>
      The Utah Reference Network, TURN, is a high-precision global navigation satellite system (GNSS) providing
      real-time corrections and data for post processing. A GNSS network consists of permanently located GPS receivers,
      installed across an area, that generate real-time, high-accuracy GPS positioning. All of the permanently installed
      GPS receivers send their data to a central system via the internet. The central system analyzes the input to
      adjust and correct the data to provide the most accurate locations, usually down to centimeter level. Our networks
      use the Trimble PIVOT VRS Platform. The generated data is sent from the GPS receiver to the GPS reference network
      through a wireless connection using the Networked Transport of RTCM via Internet Protocol (NTRIP).

    <p>The UGRC API is a free web service that allows you to geocode and search SGID data with HTTP requests.</p>
