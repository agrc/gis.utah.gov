    <p>
      UGRC is the state's map technology coordination office. We aggregate and make available important statewide data
      sets (e.g. roads, address points) to the public and for government systems; engage and advise on GIS
      implementations and best practices; and build custom tools, services, and applications for all levels of
      government throughout the state to improve their business processes by integrating spatial data.
    </p>
    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>
      The mission of UGRC is to encourage and facilitate the effective use of geospatial information and technology for
      Utah. The Utah Geospatial Resource Center (UGRC) provides a wide range of Geographic Information System (GIS) and
      other geospatial support services. UGRC strives to ensure a high level of coordination among Utah GIS users and
      effective, efficient use of GIS resources. Other services include stewardship of the State Geographic Information
      Database (SGID), facilitation of programs and activities to implement GIS technology across the state, and
      coordination of GIS policy development and implementation activities. UGRC also provides consulting services to
      federal, state, and local government and other organizations, including GIS analysis and application development,
      and map and web service development and hosting.

    <p>
      UGRC is directed under mapping-related sections of Utah statute to coordinate GIS resources within state
      government including the management of the State Geographic Information Database (SGID) and the operation of The
      Utah Reference Network for Global Positioning Systems (TURNGPS) that provides high precision correction services
      for surveying, mapping, and machine control.
    </p>
    <h2>Our History</h2>
    <p>
      UGRC was one of the first geospatial information offices in the country, established a few years before its formal
      adoption in code in 1984. After many years, our storefront remains located at the intersection of geography,
      technology, and the quest for enterprise-wide efficiency.
