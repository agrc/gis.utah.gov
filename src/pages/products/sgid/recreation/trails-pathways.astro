      The Utah Trails and Pathways map layer represents off-street features and important road connections that augment
      Utah's recreational trail and transportation network. This map layer features many of Utah's trails and pathways
      but is not yet complete.

      This dataset primarily depicts features used by hikers/pedestrians and bikers. It began with map data purchased
      from a private entity (Orbital View, Inc), for which full rights werCe purchased by the GOED Office of Outdoor
      Recreation in July 2014. Since the original purchase, subsequent substantive updates have included: 2014 Revisions
      from National Park service; 2015 additions from Emery County; June 2016 additions from Cache County US Forest
      Service Geodata Hub (all forests except Sawtooth in NW Box Elder County), and Mountainland Association of
      Governments (Utah and Wasatch counties); 2018/2019 additions as part of the multimodal project; and currently
      ongoing updates by WFRC transportation planners.
    </p>

    <p>
      Presently, the planned approach for on street bicycle lanes and routes is to incorporate them in the the statewide
      roads GIS layer using left and right side attributes. On street bike infrastructure is not expected to be
      represented in this map layer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Although it is a work in progress, this dataset represents a substantial starting point to integrate additional
      trail systems from other local, state, and federal agencies. The success of this effort will rely heavily on local
      government and land stewards to review and continue to improve upon this data. Additional segments can be
      submitted to UGRC for inclusion in this dataset.
    </p>

    <p>Note: Significant enhancements (including a schema change) were made to this layer in June 2020.</p>
