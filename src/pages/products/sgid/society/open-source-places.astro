    <p>
      This point data was generated and filtered from OpenStreetMap (OSM) and is intended to represent places of
      interest in the state of Utah. These data may include businesses, restaurants, places of worship, airports, parks,
      schools, event centers, apartment complexes, hotels, car dealerships…almost anything that you can find in OSM.
      There were over 23,000 features in the original dataset (March 2022) and users can directly contribute to it
      through <ExternalLink href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=7/39.597/-111.824">openstreetmap.org.</ExternalLink
      > The data is updated approximately once every month and will likely continue to grow over time with additional user
      input and activity.

    <h3>Data Creation Process</h3>
    <p>
      The Open Source Places layer is created by a Python script that downloads statewide OSM data from a nightly
      archive provided by Geofabrik. The archive data contains nearly 20 shapefiles, some that are relevant to this
      dataset and some that aren't.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Open Source Places layer is built by filtering the polygon and point data in those shapefiles down to a single
      point feature class with specific categories and attributes that UGRC determines would be of widest interest. The
      polygon features (buildings, areas, complexes, etc.) are converted to points using an internal centroid. Spatial
      filtering is done as the data from multiple shapefiles is combined into a single layer to minimize the occurrence
      of duplicate features. For example, a restaurant can be represented in OSM as both a point of interest and as a
      building polygon, the spatial filtering helps reduce the chances that both of these features are present in the
      final dataset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Additional de-duplication is performed by using the 'block_id' field as a spatial index to ensure that no two
      features of the same name exist within a census block. Then, additional fields are created and assigned from
      UGRC's SGID data (county, city, zip, nearby address, etc.) via point-in-polygon and near analyses. A numeric check
      is done on the 'name' field to remove features where the name is less than 3 characters long or more than 50%
      numeric characters. This eliminates several features derived from the buildings layer where the 'name' is simply
      an apartment complex building number (ex: 3A) or house number (ex: 1612).
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally, additional attributes (osm_addr, open_hours, phone, website cuisine, etc.) are pulled from the Overpass
      API and joined to the filtered data using the 'osm_id' field as the join key.
    </p>
