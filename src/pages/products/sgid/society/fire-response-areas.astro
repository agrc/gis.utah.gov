    <p>
      Fire Response Areas in Utah represent the primary agency, typically a local fire department, that will respond to
      fire-related emergencies at a given location. The dataset was created to provide response recommendations for the
      Next-Generation 911 system and was compiled from a variety of data sources. The response areas represent career
      and volunteer fire departments at a variety of levels including local, municipal, county, state, and federal
      agencies, as well as a few private or industrial organizations. The dataset was built from computer-aided dispatch
      (CAD) data within the state, tax entities, municipal boundaries, county boundaries, land ownership, inputs from
      Utah Forestry, Fire, and State Lands (FFSL), and other datasets.
