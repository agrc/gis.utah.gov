    <p>
      The PLSS data within the CadNSDI is typically survey data, control observations and other supplemental
      measurements, but in some cases survey information has not been completely abstracted or is not available and in
      these cases non Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB) information has been used such as digitized maps or data
      from other sources. In all cases the data steward is identified in the data sets and the metadata records.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PLSS Fabric is created and maintained through a collaborative partnership between the State of Utah Department
      of Technology Services, Utah Geospatial Resource Center (UGRC); the State of Utah School and Institutional Trust
      Lands Administration (SITLA), and the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM)
      and BLM contractor Premier Data Solutions (Premier) with contributions from the Utah Mapping and Information
      Partnership (UMIP) through the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).
    </p>
    <p>
      Survey Control added to the PLSS Fabric is provided by the BLM Surveyors, County Surveyors, County Contract
      Surveyors and Private Surveyors throughout the State.
