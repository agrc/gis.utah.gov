      The Public Land Survey System (PLSS) points for the State of Utah are based on Geographic Coordinate Data Base
      (GCDB) coordinate data. This data is Utah PLSS Fabric Version 2.3 2020 of the Utah GCDB.

      These are the corner points of the PLSS. This data set contains summary information about the coordinate location
      and reliability of corner coordinate information. The information in the corner feature has been collected by the
      identified data steward. For more information about corner locations, credits and use limitations the identified
      data steward in the corner feature should be contacted.

      This data set represents the GIS version of the Public Land Survey System. Updates are expected annually as
      horizontal control positions from published sources and global positioning system (GPS) observations are added.
      The primary source for the data is cadastral survey records housed by the BLM supplemented with local records and
      geographic control coordinates from states, counties as well as other federal agencies such as the USGS and USFS.
      This data was originally published on 1/3/2017.
    </p>
    <p>
      The PLSS serves as the backbone for all descriptions of private property and public land boundaries across Utah.
      Given their foundational role in legal property descriptions, it is imperative that these corner locations remain
      correct, precise, and readily available. By maintaining the accuracy of these corners and making their locations
      easily accessible, the potential for boundary discrepancies and disputes is significantly reduced, fostering
      greater clarity and confidence in land ownership and boundary delineation.
    </p>
    <p>
      To facilitate this crucial task, the Utah Geospatial Resource Center (UGRC) has developed and maintained the <ExternalLink
        href="https://plss.utah.gov">PLSS web application</ExternalLink
      > since 2013, serving as a vital resource for surveyors across the state. Initially designed to provide access to PLSS
      monument record sheets, the app has since evolved to enable surveyors to upload their own monument record sheets. Continual
      improvements are made to meet the evolving needs of surveyors, ensuring that the app remains a comprehensive and user-friendly
      tool for accessing critical survey data. You can read more about the application in our <a
        href="/solutions/for-government/application-portfolio-highlights/#plss-monument-records"
