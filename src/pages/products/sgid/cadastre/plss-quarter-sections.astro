      Quarter section data is commonly an aliquot part of a section 160 acres in size. Sections are divided by running
      straight lines from the fixed quarter section corners to the opposite corresponding quarter section corners, thus
      creating quarters of a section and defining the center of the section.

      PLSS Quarter Sections GCDB is a polygon dataset. This data is derived from the PLSSIntersected feature class of
      the Utah PLSS Fabric GIS version 2.3 2020. This layer is based on Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB)
      coordinate data. The locations of Public Land Survey System (PLSS) corners, as represented in geographic
      coordinate pairs, were derived from a variety of source documents, which include U.S. General Land Office and BLM
      survey plats/notes, as well as survey data obtained from other U.S. Government agencies, private sector survey
      firms, and local governments. The attributes assigned to PLSS polygons were taken from the BLM's Legal Land
      Description (LLD) data set, contained within the Legacy Rehost for the year 2000 (LR2000) automated records
      system. The coordinate data was produced by using control stations of known location, with varying degrees of
      accuracy, from various sources which include but are not limited to; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topological
      quadrangles and other sources, National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and US Coast & Geodetic Survey (USC&GS) Cooperative
      Base Network (CBN) control, Federal Base Network control (FBN), and Continuous Operating Reference Stations
      (CORS), and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is then analyzed and adjusted in concert with official
      survey data for any given geographic area. This data is a useful representation of the geometry and topology of
      parcels contained within the PLSS, but its application is intended for mapping purposes only. The GCDB data is not
      a substitute for a legal land survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter x,y coordinate precision; 0.001
      mile m coordinate precision). There are no constraints or warranties with regard to the use of this dataset. Users
      are encouraged to attribute content to UGRC. This statewide dataset is maintained by UGRC for navigation purposes
      and because of user's request. The geographic coordinates and their associated products are NOT legal land survey
      records. The coordinates can NOT be used as a substitute for a legal land survey. They can be used for record
      keeping, mapping, graphics and planning purposes only. No warranty is made by the Bureau of Land Management for
      use of the data for purposes not intended by BLM.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Quarter Sections are no longer a standard and is now published as a Reference layer by the UGRC. This data is
      derived from the Intersected layer of the CadNSDI published version of the PLSS, which includes quarter-quarter,
      sixteenth or government lot division, mineral surveys, and many Unsurveyed areas of the PLSS. Many areas will not
      have a designated location (NE, NW, SW, SE) in the original data so will not be classified in the Quarter Sections
      layer. This data is from the Utah PLSS Fabric Version 2.3 2020 of the Utah GCDB.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quarter Sections were consolidated from the Quarter Quarter Sections to better represent the four quarters in all
      Aliquot Part areas. Areas with Lots or Special Surveys remain as is. Updated 4/8/2022
