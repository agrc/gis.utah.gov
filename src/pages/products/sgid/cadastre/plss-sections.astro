      PLSS Sections GCDB is a polygon dataset. This entity is the primary or first subdivisions of a Public Land Survey
      System Township commonly 1 mile square approximately 640 acres.This layer is based on Geographic Coordinate Data
      Base (GCDB) coordinate data. The locations of Public Land Survey System (PLSS) corners, as represented in
      geographic coordinate pairs, were derived from a variety of source documents, which include U.S. General Land
      Office and BLM survey plats/notes, as well as survey data obtained from other U.S. Government agencies, private
      sector survey firms, and local governments. The attributes assigned to PLSS polygons were taken from the BLM's
      Legal Land Description (LLD) data set, contained within the Legacy Rehost for the year 2000 (LR2000) automated
      records system. The coordinate data was produced by using control stations of known location, with varying degrees
      of accuracy, from various sources which include but are not limited to; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topological
      quadrangles and other sources, National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and US Coast & Geodetic Survey (USC&GS) Cooperative
      Base Network (CBN) control, Federal Base Network control (FBN), and Continuous Operating Reference Stations
      (CORS), and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is then analyzed and adjusted in concert with official
      survey data for any given geographic area. This data is a useful representation of the geometry and topology of
      parcels contained within the PLSS, but its application is intended for mapping purposes only. The GCDB data is not
      a substitute for a legal land survey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter x,y coordinate precision; 0.001
      mile m coordinate precision).There are no constraints or warranties with regard to the use of this dataset. Users
      are encouraged to attribute content to UGRC. This statewide dataset is maintained by UGRC in partnership with the
      BLM and SITLA. The geographic coordinates and their associated products are NOT legal land survey records. The
      coordinates can NOT be used as a substitute for a legal land survey. They can be used for record keeping, mapping,
      graphics and planning purposes only. No warranty is made by the Bureau of Land Management for use of the data for
      purposes not intended by BLM.
