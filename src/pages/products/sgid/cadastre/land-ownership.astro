      Land ownership depicts land ownership status and areas of responsibility for the State of Utah surface lands at a
      scale of 1:24,000. This is a statewide dataset of land ownership status, and therefore is a compilation of all
      surface land ownership administration, and designation categories.

          for parcels of land and describes how, or for what use the land is to be managed (ex: Designated as
          Wilderness, National Park, State Park). This field can accommodate, if necessary, further withdrawals, leases,

          designation, the DESIG field can be used to account for this case. However, only a single designation can be
          addressed in the DESIG field; we cannot account for multiple withdrawals, leases, or permits on a parcel in
          this data standard. The data steward or editor must decide the most pertinent information to describe in the
