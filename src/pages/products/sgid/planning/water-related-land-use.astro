      Water usage-related polygon map data, published annually by the Utah Division of Water Resources at DNR that
      depicts the types and extent of irrigated crops, as well as information concerning phreatophytes, wet/open water
      areas, dry land agriculture and residential/industrial areas. The primary business driver for this dataset is for
      constructing and analyzing the state's annual water budget.

      As part of developing and updating the State Water Plan, the <ExternalLink href="https://water.utah.gov/"
        >Utah Division of Water Resources</ExternalLink
      > collects water-related land use data for the entire state. This data includes the types and extent of irrigated crops
      as well as information concerning phreatophytes, wet/open water areas, dry land agriculture and residential/industrial
      areas.
    </p>
    <p>
      The data produced by the water-related land use program are used for various planning purposes. Some of these
      include: determining cropland water use, evaluating irrigated land losses and conversion to urban uses, planning
      for new water development, estimating irrigated acreages for any area, and developing water budgets. Additionally,
      the data are utilized by many other state and federal agencies. Water-related land use can be used to depict
      Irrigation type (Irrigated, Sub-Irrigated, Non-Irrigated, Riparian, Urban, etc).
    </p>
    <p>The Landuse and IRR_Method fields are described below.</p>
    <BulletedList>
      <li>Landuse - A general land cover classification differentiating how the land is used:</li>
      <BulletedList>
        <li class="list-[circle] pl-4">Agriculture: Land managed for crop or livestock purposes.</li>
        <li class="list-[circle] pl-4">Other: A broad classification of wildland.</li>
        <li class="list-[circle] pl-4">
          Riparian/Wetland: Wildland influenced by a high water table, often close to surface water.
        </li>
        <li class="list-[circle] pl-4">Urban: Developed areas, includes urban green space such as parks.</li>
        <li class="list-[circle] pl-4">Water: Surface water such as wet flats, streams, and lakes.</li>
      </BulletedList>
      <li>
        IRR_Method - Crop Irrigation Method carried over from statewide field surveys ending in 2015 and updated based
        on imagery and yearly field checks.
      </li>
      <BulletedList>
        <li class="list-[circle] pl-4">
          Drip: Water is applied through lines that slowly release water onto the surface or subsurface of the crop.
        </li>
        <li class="list-[circle] pl-4">
          Dry Crop: No irrigation method is applied to this agricultural land, the crop is irrigated via natural
          processes.
        </li>
        <li class="list-[circle] pl-4">
          Flood: Water is diverted from ditches or pipes upland from the crop in sufficient quantities to flood the
          irrigated plot.
        </li>
        <li class="list-[circle] pl-4">None: Associated with non-agricultural land</li>
        <li class="list-[circle] pl-4">
          Sub-irrigated: This land does not have irrigation water applied, but due to a high water table receives more
          water, and is generally closely associated with a riparian area.
