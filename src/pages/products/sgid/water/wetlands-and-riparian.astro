      The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (USFWS) <ExternalLink
        href="https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wetlands-inventory">National Wetlands Inventory (NWI)</ExternalLink
      > program maintains a dataset depicting wetland and water body features across the United States. All features in the
      NWI dataset are described according to the Cowardin Classification System which uses coded values to describe vegetation
      communities, water, and disturbances present at each feature; codes can be interpreted <ExternalLink
        href="https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wetlands-inventory/classification-codes">online</ExternalLink
      >. Much of the original NWI dataset in Utah was mapped using imagery from the 1980s and may no longer accurately
      reflect current wetland locations. Several organizations, including the Utah Geological Survey, are actively
      conducting new mapping projects that update the NWI dataset for parts of the state.

      Newer mapping projects also map riparian areas, which are non-wetland areas along streams, rivers, and lakes that
      have distinct or distinctly more vigorous vegetation compared to adjacent upland areas. Riparian features are
      mapped alongside wetland features following the USFWS’s <ExternalLink
        href="https://geodata.geology.utah.gov/pages/view.php?ref=75020&"
        >A System For Mapping Riparian Areas in the United States</ExternalLink
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Metadata are a description of individual wetland and riparian mapping projects, including the scale at which
      mapping was conducted and the imagery year used for the mapping. Most mapping projects include a supplemental
      report describing who completed the project, mapping methods, and types of features captured. Unlike wetlands
      mapping, which is available statewide, riparian mapping is only available for certain projects that are depicted
      by the riparian metadata polygons.
    </p>

    <p>
      Wetlands and riparian features are mapped using a combination of aerial imagery examination and on-the-ground
      assessment. NWI mapping may serve as an initial screen of likely wetland locations, but is not suited or intended
      to replace field-based wetland delineations necessary for the permitting process.
