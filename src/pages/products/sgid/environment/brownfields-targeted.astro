      Brownfields are real property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence
      or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. Cleaning up and reinvesting in these
      properties takes development pressures off of undeveloped open land, and both improves and protects the
      environment. For more information, see <ExternalLink href="https://www.epa.gov/brownfields/"

      This data layer contains the coordinates of Brownfields Projects derived from maps and GPS data, these locations
      represent sites, not contaminated areas. The coordinate data have been created and utilized by the DERR for the
      plotting of Brownfields Projects on maps depicting the State and several counties. The data used to produce these
      maps have been reviewed by DERR staff and found to be adequate for DERR's purposes which require the depiction of
      general locational information. The accuracy of these locations may not be sufficient for other purposes. Persons
      relying upon these maps do so at their own risk. The DERR assumes no responsibility or liability for the accuracy
      of these points.
