      Address system quadrants represents the local and countywide address system quadrants (NE, SE, SW, NW) throughout
      Utah. Addresses are assigned by local government addressing authorities using a defined addressing system, or
      grid. An addressing system consists of an origin point (0,0), a north-south axis, and an east-west axis, and a
      boundary within which addresses are assigned using this particular grid. This convention governs the assignment of
      addresses and is typically expressed as 100 address ranges per block or 800 address ranges per mile.

      James Wingate, formerly of Blue Stakes, compiled most of the address coordinate system descriptions listed below.
      UGRC will update this list as more information is brought to our attention. If you have additional information or
      corrections to contribute, please contribute % include contact.html subject=page.title

      UGRC created this polygon feature class to approximate the boundaries of each local address coordinate system
      (ACS) and each quadrant (NE, NW, SE, SW) within each local ACS.

        This is <em>different</em> from most cities, where even addresses are typically on the right and odds on the left
        as you move outward from the address origin. This is the case for the entire county, although supposedly a few addresses
        have deviated.

        The unincorporated county origin covers all of Duchesne County except for the areas within Duchesne City, Myton
        and Roosevelt city boundaries. A significant portion of Uintah County also counts from this origin, including
        the municipality of Ballard Town and roughly 25% of the unincorporated area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roosevelt City grid and County grid both have same 0 E/W, but their 0 N/S locations differ by two blocks. This
        can be slightly confusing, as evidenced by traveling north along State St in Roosevelt. Proceeding north from
        Lagoon St, after a few blocks you will hit 500 N (City), then 600 N (City) and then 500 N (County). This is
        because the county origin begins two blocks farther north than the city origin.

          Springdale - No prefix or suffix directionals used. There is also no official address origin. If there was an
        </li>
        origin, it would be where Zion Park Blvd (SR 9) meets the north city boundary line, which is also the border of Zion
        National Park. Zion Park Blvd (ZPB) would be the zero road, where addresses along the cross streets get larger as
        they get farther away from ZPB. But there is no standard of how far addresses count; the addresses could jump by
        2 from house to house or by 50. All segments of ZPB have S as the prefix directional, since the origin would be the
        north city boundary. E-911 is uses address points for Springdale. (per Tom Dansie - Director of Community Development
