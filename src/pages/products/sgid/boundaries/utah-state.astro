      Utah State Boundary is maintained by UGRC with the help of many state, county, and local entities. Changes and
      updates are through certification by the Lt. Governor's Office sent in by City and County Recorders offices. All
      features are adjusted to the current Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB) points.

      Data developed with coordinate geometry (COGO) from legal descriptions were used. When necessary the data were
      adjusted to conform to known physical features. This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, but,
      rather a set of boundaries used for the administrative purposes that conforms to logical & administrative rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the boundary of the state of Utah this dataset contains another larger boundary around the state
      that can be used for cartographic purposes to mask other data layers that extend past the boundary of the state.
      The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter coordinate precision). The state
      boundary dataset is is maintained by UGRC in partnership with state and local government.
