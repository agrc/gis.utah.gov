      Retail culinary water suppliers service area boundaries for the State of Utah, with a small selection of suppliers
      in Idaho and Wyoming represented as well. Data sources include the Utah Division of Water Resources (DWRe), Utah
      Division of Drinking Water, Utah Division of Water Rights, Utah Division of Public Utilities, and the Utah
      Geospatial Resource Center. Boundaries were derived from a combination of the following data layers available in
      the SGID: Counties, various county parcels, Municipalities, PLSSSections, and TaxEntities.

    <p>
      Utah Retail Culinary Water Service Areas represent public community water suppliers. Eventually, public
      non-community (transient) and self-supplied industry (non-transient) suppliers will be added. This feature class
      includes system boundaries that are historical and no longer active. It also includes some systems that are
      outside the state. Historical and outside the state systems can be filtered using the <code>ENDYEAR</code> and
      <code>STATE</code> fields, respectively. These boundaries are derived from many different sources, including spatial
      data received directly from the supplier, municipal boundaries, phone call descriptions of service areas, printed maps
      that had hand drawn boundaries that were then digitized, etc.
