      You can connect to Discover using a variety of desktop and web clients, including QGIS, ArcGIS Pro, AutoCAD, and
      ArcGIS Online. These instructions generally apply to the WMTS links, but the WMS process is usually similar (if
      not identical).
    </p>
    <p>
      If your client asks for authentication info, you can leave that section blank. Discover handles authentication
      through the unique links sent to each user.

      The <ExternalLink href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/">ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript</ExternalLink> provides
      a class for interacting with these services, called a <ExternalLink
        href="https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest/api-reference/esri-layers-WebTileLayer.html"
        >WebTileLayer</ExternalLink
      >. Using this class is as simple as passing in the URL to the WMTS service with the appropriate level, column, and
      row tokens. For example:
    </p>

    <p>
      There is one caveat to using discover services with WebTileLayer; it does not store metadata about the service.
      The piece of metadata that will affect developers the most is the cache level information. WebTileLayer's cache
      levels are based on a suggested set that is common amongst popular tile providers. The suggested set uses 0
      through 19. If the base map you are using deviates from these levels (most of our base maps are 0-19 but <a
        href="/documentation/developer/base-maps/basemap-scales">there are a few exceptions</a
      >), you will be responsible for setting those values or you will not be given the UI to see the full tile set. As
      you can see in the sample below it takes a fair amount of work.
    </p>

      UGRC has a widget called <ExternalLink href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ugrc/layer-selector"
        >layer-selector</ExternalLink
      > that handles these issues as well as makes working with base maps more streamlined. It's main purpose is to provide
      users the ability to quickly switch between base maps and toggle associated overlays.
