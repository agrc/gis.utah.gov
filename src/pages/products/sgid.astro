      <p>
        Established by State law in 1991, Utah's State Geographic Information Datasource (SGID) provides a centralized
        collection of hundreds of GIS data layers developed, aggregated, or acquired by the State. Evolving technologies
        have allowed us to transform the SGID from a single database to a broad collection of data resources under the
        SGID umbrella. It contains both UGRC-curated datasets and references to data from a wide variety of state and
        local agencies. Many resources have both download links and links to web services for direct consumption.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many facets, or parts, to the SGID today, with each one addressing specific audiences and
        technologies. The SGID Index combines all of these facets plus links to externally-hosted resources to make it
        easy to find the latest and highest quality GIS data resources no matter where they're hosted.
      </p>
      <p>
        UGRC and our numerous partners at cities, counties, and state agencies are working hard to maintain this
        high-quality asset to help everyone discover, access, and use Utah GIS data resources.

          The SGID on ArcGIS site is a single destination for GIS resources hosted in multiple agencies. Each item in the
          Hub contains data download links along with web service links for consuming the datasets in webmaps and other applications.
          We share all our curated datasets through the site and encourage other agencies and organizations to <a
