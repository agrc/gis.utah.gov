        The SGID aims to be the primary source for state-wide GIS data in Utah by creating a single portal to datasets created
        by many different agencies and organizations. With such a broad scope, SGID datasets live in many different places
        depending on their type, availability, and popularity.

        SGID data is organized into 27 categories to help you find the data you need. e.g. boundaries, cadastre, elevation
        and terrain, and water to name a few. Within the Open SGID, these are schemas. In the SGID on ArcGIS they are groups.
        Each category contains datasets that relate to the parent category. This organization helps you discover the data
        you need and related datasets you might not have known about for your projects or learning.

        The SGID Index is <span class="font-bold">the primary source</span> of information for SGID datasets. It includes
        links to detailed information pages about UGRC-maintained datasets as well as direct links to the authoritative sources
        for datasets served by other state agencies. The index lists the resource's category, name, and primary data steward,
        along with a short description of the resource and links to web services (if available).
