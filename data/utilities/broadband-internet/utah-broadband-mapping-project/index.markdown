<p>The<strong> </strong><a href="http://www.utah.gov/broadband/index.html">Utah Broadband Mapping, Analysis and Planning Projec</a>t is an ongoing project with the Governor’s Office of Economic Development and the Public Service Commission, sponsored by the FCC(?).  AGRC's role is to maintain a detailed map of broadband internet coverage for the state of Utah.</p>
<p>To maintain the map, AGRC collects data twice a year on the availability, speed and location of broadband services, as well as broadband services used by public institutions such as schools, libraries, etc. AGRC transforms this data into a standardized format, and the data is submitted to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.</p>
<p>The data is also used in Utah to assist in broadband infrastructure planning, and is available to the public for broadband availability inquiries.  The broadband data is best explored on the <a href="http://utah.gov/broadband/map.html">Utah Broadband Interactive Map</a>.</p>
<p>This broadband mapping and planning initiative, launched in 2009, is being undertaken across all 50 U.S. states and 5 U.S. territories through the <a title="SBDD" href="http://www2.ntia.doc.gov/SBDD" target="_blank">State Broadband Data and Development </a>(SBDD) Program, which is being administered by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration.</p>
