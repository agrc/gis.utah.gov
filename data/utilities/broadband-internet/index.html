    <p>Broadband service depicts broadband coverage over any transmission technology, including fixed and mobile
      services. Fixed service is typically used as a home internet connection over DSL, other copper, cable, and fiber
      technologies. This data is open to be utilized for public analysis. Note that historic broadband coverage dates
      from Fall 2015. For broadband coverage previous to Fall 2015, see SBI Broadband Data.</p>
    <h5>Disclaimer</h5>
    <p>Broadband service availability and characteristics are depicted as derived from data assembled by the Utah
      Broadband Outreach Center mapping team. Data sources include biannual broadband service provider submissions and
      publicly available sources. Speeds shown are the 'maximum advertised' for the geographic features depicted, and
      must exceed 0.768 Mbps download and 0.2 Mbps upload to be included. Actual speeds may vary within service area,
      due to the granularity and currency of the data, technological limitations, and service plan limitations. Users of
      the site are encouraged to inquire directly to providers for current service availability and speed. All
      information presented on the Utah's interactive broadband map is for general reference purposes only and may
      contain errors and omissions. The State of Utah makes no warranty with respect to information available, express
      or implied, including but not limited to the fitness for use for a particular purpose. This data is managed by
      UGRC for the Governorâ€™s Office of Economic Development Broadband Outreach Center.</p>

    <p>From 2010 - 2014, the State of Utah maintained a broadband mapping database in the format defined by the State
      Broadband Initative (SBI) Program at the National Telecommunications & Information Administration (NTIA). Data was
      collected twice a year and submitted to the NTIA biannually on April 1 and October 1. </p>

    <h5>Disclaimer</h5>
    <p>Broadband service availability and characteristics are depicted as derived from data assembled by the Utah
      Broadband Project. Data sources include biannual broadband service provider submissions and publicly available
      sources. Data has been modified, where necessary, to meet broadband mapping standards set by the National
      Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).</p>
    <p>Broadband service availability is displayed per NTIA specifications which include technology and speed categories
      and the aggregation of non-wireless service availability information to either U.S. Census blocks (where smaller
      than 2 sq. miles) or road segments.</p>
    <p>Speeds shown are the 'maximum advertised' for the geographic features depicted, and must exceed 0.768 Mbps
      download and 0.2 Mbps upload (NTIA broadband definition) to be included. Actual speeds may vary within and along
      census blocks and roads, due to the granularity and currency of the data, technological limitations, and service
      plan limitations. Users of the site are encouraged to inquire directly to providers for current service
      availability and speed.</p>
