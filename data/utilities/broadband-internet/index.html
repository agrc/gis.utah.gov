<h4><strong>Broadband Internet</h4>
<p></strong><br />
<strong>Data Type:</strong> GIS Data Layer<br />
<strong>Steward(s):</strong> AGRC & The Governor's Office Of Economic Development (GOED)</p>
<p><strong>Abstract:</strong><br />
This dataset contains the statewide availability of broadband internet in Utah. The data represents broadband providers' coverage areas, with their technology types and maximum advertised download and upload speeds. This mapping data is a product of the State of Utah Broadband Project.<br />
<BR><br />
<strong>Data Content:</strong><br />
The following data is available for download:</p>
<div class="grid package">
    <div class="grid__col grid__col--12-of-12">
        <h3 id="WirelineBroadbandData">Wireline Broadband Data</h3>

<img class="productImage-Thumb" src="{{ "/images/gallery/sgid/bbwireline_2.png?1797489756" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="BBWireline" />Wireline broadband internet includes DSL, other copper, cable, and fiber technologies. The data is mapped using census blocks and in areas of census blocks over two square miles, road segments.
</p>
<p>This data is open to be utilized for public analysis.</p>
<p>Disclaimer:<br />
Broadband service availability and characteristics are depicted as derived from data assembled by the Utah Broadband Project. Data sources include biannual broadband service provider submissions and publicly available sources. Data has been modified, where necessary, to meet broadband mapping standards set by the National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA).</p>
<p>Broadband service availability is displayed per NTIA specifications which include technology and speed categories and the aggregation of non-wireless service availability information to either U.S. Census blocks (where smaller than 2 sq. miles) or road segments.</p>
<p>Speeds shown are the 'maximum advertised' for the geographic features depicted, and must exceed 0.768 Mbps download and 0.2 Mbps upload (NTIA broadband definition) to be included. Actual speeds may vary within and along census blocks and roads, due to the granularity and currency of the data, technological limitations, and service plan limitations. Users of the site are encouraged to inquire directly to providers for current service availability and speed.</p>
<p>All information presented on the Utah's interactive broadband map is for general reference purposes only and may contain errors and omissions. The State of Utah makes no warranty with respect to information available, express or implied, including but not limited to the fitness for use for a particular purpose.</p>
