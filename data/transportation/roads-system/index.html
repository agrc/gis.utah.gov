    <p>Transportation.Roads is a multi-purpose statewide roads dataset for cartography, routing, and range based-address
      location. This dataset is also used as the base geometry for deriving the GIS-representation of UDOT’s highway
      linear referencing system (LRS) as well as UGRC's <a
        href="{% link data/transportation/street-network-analysis/index.html %}">network analysis datasets</a>.</p>
    <p>This layer also plays an important role in <a
        href="{% link data/transportation/street-network-analysis/index.html %}#MultimodalNetwork">active transportation
        planning</a> in Utah. Recent collaborative efforts between UGRC, <a
        href="https://www.udot.utah.gov/connect/">UDOT</a>, and <a href="https://wfrc.org/">WFRC</a> have led to <a
        href="{% link _posts/2020-05-27-bike-related-gis-data-resources.md %}">significant enhancements</a> in the bike
      and pedestrian data in both the Roads and <a
        href="{% link data/recreation/trails/index.html %}">Trails-and-Pathways</a> layers. These efforts have focused
      on <a href="{% link _posts/2020-06-26-enhancements-to-sgid-utah-trails-dataset.md %}">better connectivity</a>
      between the layers (<a href="{% link _posts/2018-11-07-multi-modal-travel-shed-analysis-project.md %}">along the
        Wasatch Front</a>), as well as improvements in the <a
        href="{% link _posts/2021-01-08-statewide-bike-data.md %}">statewide bike data</a>. You can contribute to the

        us know</a> where we have gaps or inaccurate information.</p>
    <p>Transportation.Roads utilizes a data model based on Next-Generation 911 standards and the Federal Highway
      Administration's All Roads Network Of Linear-referenced Data (ARNOLD) reporting requirements for state DOTs. UGRC
      <a href="{% link _posts/2017-08-15-major-updates-coming-to-roads-data-model.md %}">adopted</a> this data model on
      September 13th, 2017.
    </p>
    <p>To see specific information about the data model including field names and descriptions, data types, coded value
      domains, and data model updates, see the <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jQ_JuRIEtzxj60F0FAGmdu5JrFpfYBbSt3YzzCjxpfI/edit#gid=811360546">data
        model spreadsheet</a> and the corresponding tabs for update notes and coded value domains. The color-coded
      section titled <code>Addressing</code> is primarily maintained by the local stewards, where as the section titled
      <code>DOT/FHWA</code> is primarily maintained by UDOT. UGRC spatially assigns fields in the section titled
      <code>Placename/Area</code>, based on current SGID polygon boundaries. UGRC also generates the
      <code>UNIQUE_ID</code> field based on the segment's location in the US National Grid, with the street name then
      tacked on. The <code>UNIQUE_ID</code> field is static and is UGRC's current, ad hoc solution to a persistent
      global id.
    </p>
    <p>This data model is meant to suggest 'best practices'. It is not the intent that all stewards will change their
      current data management process to match this standard, but rather that stewards will evaluate their current
      practices to see how well their data 'maps' to this schema for data sharing and Next Generation 911 preparedness.

    <p>We are currently working with US Forest Service to improve the Forest Service roads in this dataset, however, for
      the most current and complete set of USFS roads, please visit the <a

        Clearinghouse</a>.</p>
    <p>The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter coordinate precision). The
      statewide roads dataset is maintained by UGRC in partnership with local government, the Utah 911 Committee, and
      UDOT.</p>

    <p>The UDOT Routes ALRS layer is a polylineM dataset wherein each state and federal route is a single feature whose
      vertices include a milepoint measure coordinate.</p>
    <p>Major routes (shown in the <code>ROUTE_ID</code> field) are named using UDOT’s naming convention (ex. 0089PM is
      US-89, a mainline route in the positive direction). Ramps and collectors are also included and have 11 character
      identifiers (ex. 0015NR31703 is at exit 317 on I-15).</p>
    <img class="center" src="{% link images/udot_ramp_numbering.png %}" alt="UDOT Ramp Codes Diagram" loading="lazy" />
    <p><code>ROUTE_ID</code> field codes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><code>P</code> represents Positive direction (increasing milepoint values)
      <li><code>N</code> represents Negative direction (for divided routes only)
      <li><code>M</code> represents Mainline
      <li><code>R</code> represents Ramp
      <li><code>C</code> represents Collector
      <li><code>X</code> represents Other
    </ul>
    <p>The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83. The GIS dataset representing the UDOT ALRS
      is stewarded by UDOT with assistance from DTS, UGRC and local government.</p>
    <p>The <code>CARTO_CODE</code> field can be used to query subsets or classify different types of UDOT routes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1 - Interstate highways
      <li>2 - US highways
      <li>3 - State highways
      <li>5 - Miscellaneous routes associated with interchanges
      <li>6 - Ramps, Interstates
      <li>7 - Ramps, US Highways
      <li>8 - Ramps, State highways
      <li>9 - Local routes, federal aid
      <li>I - Institutional roads designated as state highways
