The network datasets have been derived from the <a
  href="{% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}">Transportation.Roads</a> dataset and are designed to be
used for network analysis (drive times, routes, service areas).

    <p><a href="{% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}">Transportation.Roads</a> is the recommended
      starting point for almost anything related to Utah street centerlines. This includes cartography, address
      location, and, now, network analysis. (It is also worth mentioning that the UDOT linear referencing system is
      derived from attributes in this dataset).</p>
    <p>While data used to support network analysis has many potential parameters, at a basic level, two components are
      especially important: 1) connectivity and 2) impedance (i.e. travel speed/costs).</p>
    <p>Connectivity of centerline features in Transportation.Roads is actively maintained but an impedance measure,
      while planned for later this year, has not been actively enforced to date. However, it is possible to use a
      combination of cartographic feature codes (<code>CFCC</code> field), spatial queries, and the existing values in
      the <code>SPD_LMT</code> field to create a relatively crude but effective representation of speed limits that,
      then, can be used as an input to an impedance measure.</p>
    Important Fields:
    <ul class="dotless">
      <li><code>F_T_IMP_MIN</code> Impedance, estimated in minutes in direction of line's orientation.</li>
      <li><code>T_F_IMP_MIN</code> Impedance, estimated in minutes in the opposite direction of line's orientation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In areas where surface streets are likely to encounter traffic controls at intersections and other congestion,
      travel time has been increased by a factor of 1.3 (this will be 1.5 in future datasets). Otherwise the approximate
      speed limit was used to estimate travel time.</p>
    <p>There are no constraints or warranties with regard to the use of this dataset.</p>

    <p>The multimodal network dataset was originally developed as part of a 2018 FHWA-funded <a
        href='{% link _posts/2018-11-07-multi-modal-travel-shed-analysis-project.md %}'>Multimodal Travelshed
        Project</a>. The project, led by UDOT, was a pilot for <a
        href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B0e8NYR9m9MTX091S3d5Ri00S2drVi16ZDNyZFRhb3dFT3VZ/view"> measuring
        multimodal network connectivity</a>. Other partners included WFRC, MAG, and UGRC.</p>
    <p>This dataset is built using SGID <a href="{% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}">Roads</a>, <a
        href="{% link data/recreation/trails/index.html %}">Trails</a>, and <a
        href="{% link data/transportation/transit/index.html %}">UTA Transit</a> (light-rail and commuter rail) data, as
      well as 2019 <a href="https://gtfs.org/">GTFS</a> transit routes and stops. In addition, ‘connector’ lines are
      created during the build process to provide the needed junctions.</p>
    <p>Currently, the dataset is limited to the <a
        href="https://github.com/gregbunce/MultimodalNetworkScripts/blob/master/data/WasatchFrontRegion.geojson">Wasatch
        Front region</a> (Box Elder, Davis, Salt Lake, Utah, and Weber county). Furthermore, as part of the scope of the
      project, <a
        href="https://github.com/gregbunce/MultimodalNetworkScripts/blob/master/data/multimodal_50_sites.geojson">50
        sites</a> were chosen where the data is optimized for multimodal connectivity (particularly the bike and
      pedestrian modes of travel). Pedestrian data was densified within <a
        href="https://github.com/gregbunce/MultimodalNetworkScripts/blob/master/data/multimodal_50_sites_halfmile_buff.geojson">.5
        miles of the sites</a> and bike data was densified within <a
        href="https://github.com/gregbunce/MultimodalNetworkScripts/blob/master/data/multimodal_50_sites_1mile_buff.geojson">1
        mile of the sites</a>. In other words, your mileage may vary when you venture beyond these zones.</p>
    <p>The multimodal network dataset will be updated in conjunction with <a
        href="{% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}">SGID Road updates</a>.</p>
    <p>This dataset can also be used with ESRI's Network Analyst for routing and <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OsXexJTap9tDY89Y_v2woGatK_u5nYd_jDdlMwWRhog/edit"> travel sheds</a>.
    </p>
    <p>Please visit this project’s <a href="https://github.com/gregbunce/MultimodalNetworkScripts">GitHub repository</a>
      to learn more about (or contribute to) the build process.</p>
    <p>We hope to continue the project and expand the multimodal footprint beyond these original 50 sites. Please get in
      contact with us if you are interested in contributing or playing a role.</p>
