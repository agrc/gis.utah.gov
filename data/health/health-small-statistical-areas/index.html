abstract="First developed by the Department of Health in 1997, small statistical areas provide a means of geographically analyzing and presenting health statistics at the community level. Producing information at this level provides community planners and others with information that is specific to the populations living in their communities. Small area analysis allows an investigator to explore ecologic relationships between health status, lifestyle, the environment and the health system." %}

    <p>"Utah Small Health Statistics Areas" was developed by the Utah Department of Health by combining neighboring ZIP code areas to create 99 small areas ranging in population of approximately 8,000 to 86,000 persons. These boundaries were created to allow for more meaningful analysis by reducing areas to the smallest unit where there is enough data to be reliable and the area is similar. </p>
