abstract="First developed by the Department of Health in 1997, small statistical areas provide a means of geographically
analyzing and presenting health statistics at the community level. Producing information at this level provides
community planners and others with information that is specific to the populations living in their communities. Small
area analysis allows an investigator to explore ecologic relationships between health status, lifestyle, the environment
and the health system." %}

    <p>Utah Small Health Statistics Areas was developed by the Utah Department of Health by combining neighboring ZIP
      code areas to create 99 small areas ranging in population of approximately 8,000 to 86,000 persons. In some
      instances a small area may not have a contiguous boundary, in these cases the small area is represented with
      multiple polygons. These boundaries were created to allow for more meaningful analysis by reducing areas to the
      smallest unit where there is enough data to be reliable and the area is similar.</p>
