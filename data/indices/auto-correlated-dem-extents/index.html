    <p>AutoCorrelated DEM Extents is a polygon dataset of the areas where auto-correlated DEM elevation is
      available in the State of Utah.</p>
    <p><strong>The auto-correlation process is not as rigorous as other methods of elevation modeling such as
        photogrammetry, LiDAR mapping, radar mapping, etc, and therefore end-users should be aware that anomalies are
        expected within the elevation dataset.</strong></p>
    <p>These boundaries are maintained by UGRC with the help of many state, county, and local entities. Changes and
      updates are made as new auto-correlated DEM elevation data is a acquired in Utah.</p>
    <p>The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter coordinate precision).</p>
    <p>Each polygon extent contains the following attribute fields when available or applicable:</p>
    <ul class="dotless no-padding">
      <li><strong>Resolution</strong> - the resolution or pixel size of the data
      <li><strong>Year_Collected</strong> - the year collected
      <li><strong>Description</strong> - a short description
      <li><strong>File_Format</strong> - the file format
      <li><strong>File_Extension</strong> - the file extension
      <li><strong>Average_File_Size</strong> - the average file size of an individual image tile
      <li><strong>Total_Size</strong> - the total file size of the entire product collection
      <li><strong>Horizontal_Accuracy</strong> - the horizontal positional accuracy
      <li><strong>Vertical_Accuracy</strong> - the vertical positional accuracy
      <li><strong>Total_Square_Miles</strong> - the total square miles of the dataset
      <li><strong>Contact</strong> - contact information
      <li><strong>In_House</strong> - whether or not it is distributed from UGRC's FTP site
      <li><strong>FTP_Path</strong> - the FTP directory to download the data from
      <li><strong>Product</strong> - a generalize product name
      <li><strong>Category</strong> - a generalized product category name
      <li><strong>Estimated_Date</strong> - an estimated date the data was collected
      <li><strong>HTML_Page</strong> - the URL to a webpage for the product
      <li><strong>REST_Endpoint</strong> - the REST end point URL
      <li><strong>LYR_File</strong> - a layer pointer and symbology
      <li><strong>FlightDate_Location</strong> - where to find the exact flight date for each individual tile of data
      <li><strong>Tile_Index</strong> - the tile index in the SGID for each product
      <li><strong>Upload_Date</strong> - the date the polygon extent was loaded into the dataset
    </ul>
