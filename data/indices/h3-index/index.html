    <p>The <a href='https://h3geo.org/'>H3 Spatial Index</a> (created by Uber) helps users aggregate point data using an easily reusable common grid. This allows you to maintain a consistent geometry across all your analyses, which makes them easier to compare. H3 uses highly-optimized math routines to assign lat/long coordinates an ID corresponding to a polygon (almost always hexes) at a given resolution rather than performing a much slower point-in-polygon geometrical operation. Once you've generated IDs for your points, you can use these polygons to aggregate them and display summary statistics on a map.</p>
    <p>We used the H3 library to create the index polygons that cover the entire State of Utah at resolutions 5 through 9. You can find more information about how we created them, along with an example of how to use them, in our <a href='{% link _posts/2022-10-26-using-h3-hexes.md %}'>H3 blog post</a>.</p>
    <p>Like the rest of our SGID data, the spatial reference for these polygons is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83. However, remember that your points must be in WGS 84 lat/long in order to use the H3 API to assign them a hex ID. The polygons are copyright 2022 Uber Technologies, Inc and licensed under version 2.0 of the <a href='http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0'> Apache License</a>.</p>
