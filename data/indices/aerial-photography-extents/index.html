    <p>INDICES.Aerial_Photography_Extents is a polygon dataset of the areas where aerial photography is available in the
      State of Utah.</p>
    <p>INDICES.Aerial_Photography_Extents is intended to be used to determine what aerial photography datasets are
      available for areas across the State of Utah.</p>
    <p>Each polygon extent contains the following attribute fields when available or applicable:</p>
    <ul class="dotless">
      <li><strong>Resolution</strong> - the resolution or pixel size of the imagery
      <li><strong>Year_Collected</strong> - the year collected
      <li><strong>Description</strong> - a short description
      <li><strong>File_Format</strong> - the file format
      <li><strong>File_Extension</strong> - the file extension
      <li><strong>Average_File_Size</strong> - the average file size of an individual image tile
      <li><strong>Total_Size</strong> - the total file size of the entire product collection
      <li><strong>Horizontal_Accuracy</strong> - the horizontal positional accuracy
      <li><strong>Vertical_Accuracy</strong> - the vertical positional accuracy
      <li><strong>Total_Square_Miles</strong> - the total square miles of the dataset
      <li><strong>Contact</strong> - contact information
      <li><strong>In_House</strong> - whether or not it is distributed from UGRC's FTP site
      <li><strong>FTP_Path</strong> - the FTP directory to download the data from
      <li><strong>Product</strong> - a generalize product name
      <li><strong>Category</strong> - a generalized product category name
      <li><strong>Estimated_Date</strong> - an estimated date the data was collected
      <li><strong>HTML_Page</strong> - the URL to a webpage for the product
      <li><strong>REST_Endpoint</strong> - the REST end point URL
      <li><strong>LYR_File</strong> - a layer pointer and symbology
      <li><strong>FlightDate_Location</strong> - where to find the exact flight date for each individual tile of data
      <li><strong>Tile_Index</strong> - the tile index in the SGID for each product
      <li><strong>Upload_Date</strong> - the date the polygon extent was loaded into the dataset
    </ul>
    <p>These boundaries are maintained by UGRC with the help of many state, county, and local entities. Changes and
      updates are made as new imagery is a acquired in Utah. The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone
      12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter coordinate precision). There are no constraints or warranties with regard to the use of
      this dataset. Users are encouraged to attribute content to: State of Utah, SGID.</p>
