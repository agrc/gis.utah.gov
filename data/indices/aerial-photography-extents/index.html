      <li><strong>File_Format</strong> - the file format
      <li><strong>File_Extension</strong> - the file extension
      <li><strong>Average_File_Size</strong> - the average file size of an individual image tile
      <li><strong>Total_Size</strong> - the total file size of the entire product collection
      <li><strong>Horizontal_Accuracy</strong> - the horizontal positional accuracy
      <li><strong>Vertical_Accuracy</strong> - the vertical positional accuracy
      <li><strong>Total_Square_Miles</strong> - the total square miles of the dataset
      <li><strong>Contact</strong> - contact information
      <li><strong>In_House</strong> - whether or not it is distributed from UGRC's FTP site
