    <td>The Utah statewide Beaver Restoration Assessment Tool (BRAT) is a decision support and planning tool for beaver
      management. The backbone to BRAT is a capacity model developed to assess the upper limits of riverscapes to
      support beaver dam-building
      activities. Both existing and potential capacity were estimated with readily available spatial datasets to
      evaluate five key lines of evidence: 1) a perennial water source, 2) availability of dam building materials, 3)
      ability to build a dam
      at baseflow, 4) likelihood of dams to withstand a typical flood, and 5) likelihood that stream gradient would
      limit or completely eliminate dam building by beaver. Fuzzy inference systems were used to combine these lines of
      evidence while accounting
      for uncertainty.</td>
