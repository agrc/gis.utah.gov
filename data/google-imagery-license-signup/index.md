### Background
{: .text-left}

At the beginning of 2015, a coalition of state, regional, and local government agencies purchased a license to Google's high resolution (6 inch pixels) aerial photography. _Read the original [post]({{site.baseurl}}{% post_url 2015-02-02-utah-acquires-high-resolution-aerial-photography-license %}) about the acquisition_. The license will allow Utah's **cities, counties, special districts, state agencies, K12/Higher ed, and tribes** to use this imagery in web and desktop mapping  applications as a streaming web service or, where needed, on premise from downloaded local files. Also included is **use by contractors and formal partners of the immediate licensees**.

The imagery web services will be hosted in Google's cloud and delivered via `WMS` and `WTMS` Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) standards via AGRC's cloud-based  Discover service. The original `.jp2` imagery tiles can be downloaded or obtainable from AGRC who has a master set of the raw imagery files.

### Sign Up Information
{: .text-left}

Each qualified entity will need to complete an <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/utah.gov/forms/d/18FnT2fdg7nrA9xZYKUYV5UvxG0GO9w9DNFfeNG1D4TU/viewform"><strong>Organizational Usage Agreement</strong></a> to access the imagery. The Agreement covers terms of the license and important informational items that should be communicated. Spend some time with the fine print within the Agreement as it is important that everyone understand the details, including, but not limited to the importance of understanding datum transformation.

Please note that the agreement only needs to be completed once for each organization and that contractors working only within the physical facilities or network of immediate licensees, do not need complete the Agreement.

<a title="911flyer" href="https://docs.google.com/a/utah.gov/forms/d/18FnT2fdg7nrA9xZYKUYV5UvxG0GO9w9DNFfeNG1D4TU/viewform"><img class="inline-text-left" src="{{ "/images/googleusageagreement.png" | prepend: site.baseurl }}" alt="ned" /></a>

It is recommended that larger organizations (e.g. State Departments or Counties) decide whether they want to submit one agreement or one for each sub unit within their organization (e.g. divisions, regional offices, local government offices). In making this decision, please consider that it will create a small amount of additional work for AGRC staff but will also create additional points of contact, additional usage statistics, and could distribute the responsibility for communicating the terms and informational items within a larger organization. It's an organization-by-organization decision, so please take time to coordinate with leadership and your co-workers to arrive at the best solution.

After completing the Organizational Usage Agreement, AGRC will work through the designated primary contact to provide connection information via the Google Cloud Platform (GCP). GCP, similar to Amazon's AWS, will provide flexibility, cost efficiencies, and powerful scaling using the Compute Engine. AGRC will be able to distribute the original `.jp2` image files to qualifying organizations with on-premise use needs for the files or local mosaics (911, Blue Stakes, etc).

Get started by getting a primary contact designated for your organization and sign up using the <a href="https://docs.google.com/a/utah.gov/forms/d/18FnT2fdg7nrA9xZYKUYV5UvxG0GO9w9DNFfeNG1D4TU/viewform"><strong>Organizational Usage Agreement</strong></a>.
