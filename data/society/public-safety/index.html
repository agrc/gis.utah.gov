    <p>Correctional Facilities contains locations for jails and prisons in Utah. A jail or prison defined by the
      Department of Justice consists of any facility or location where individuals are regularly and lawfully detained
      against their will. This includes Federal and State prisons, local jails, and juvenile detention facilities, as
      well as law enforcement temporary holding facilities. Locations which function primarily as law enforcement
      offices are included in this dataset if they have holding cells.</p>

    <p>Fire Response Areas in Utah represent the primary agency, typically a local fire department, that will respond to
      fire-related emergencies at a given location. The dataset was created to provide response recommendations for the
      Next-Generation 911 system and was compiled from a variety of data sources. The response areas represent career
      and volunteer fire departments at a variety of levels including local, municipal, county, state, and federal
      agencies, as well as a few private or industrial organizations. The dataset was built from computer-aided dispatch
      (CAD) data within the state, tax entities, municipal boundaries, county boundaries, land ownership, inputs from Utah
      Forestry, Fire, and State Lands (FFSL), and other datasets.</p>

    <p>EMS Response Areas in Utah represent the primary agency that will respond to medical emergencies at a given location.
      The dataset was created to provide response recommendations for the Next-Generation 911 system and was compiled from a
      variety of data sources. The response areas represent a variety of service levels (paramedic, advanced EMT, with or without
      transport capability, etc.), but generally include 911 scene response. The data was compiled using written descriptions
      from the licensing database of the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services and Preparedness <a href="https://bemsp.utah.gov/">(BEMSP)</a>,
      which is part of the Utah Department of Health and Human Services' (DHHS). In some instances, the BEMSP data was incomplete
      or the written descriptions were inaccurate, contradictory, ambiguous, or failed to close. To make the data more complete,
      computer-aided dispatch (CAD) data from within the state was used to resolve conflicts, fill in gaps, and improve completeness.</p>

    <p>Law Enforcement Facilities contains locations in Utah where sworn officers of a law enforcement agency are
      regularly based or stationed. Law enforcement facilities are at least partially publicly funded. This law
      enforcement dataset includes federal, state, local and special jurisdiction facilities. Examples of law
      enforcement facilities included are municipal police, county sheriffs, state police, school police, park police,
      railroad police, and federal police.</p>

    <p>Law Enforcement Boundaries contains jurisdictional boundaries for law enforcement agencies in Utah. Law
      enforcement boundaries indicate which law enforcement agency has the primary responsibility in a specific area.
      These boundaries are also used in the Next-Generation 911 system for recommending which agency should respond to a
      specific location.</p>

      jurisdictional boundary representations of the Navajo Nation Tribal Lands, Hill Air Force Base, and Colorado City.</p>
