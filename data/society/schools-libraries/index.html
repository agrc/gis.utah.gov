    <p>This dataset contains point locations for preschool and K-12 schools in the state of Utah - updated for the 2019-2020 school year. Higher education and adult vocational training are not included in the dataset.</p>
    <p>The <code>schools_prek_to_12</code> dataset was built in collaboration with <a href="https://wfrc.org/">Wasatch Front Regional Council</a> (WFRC), the <a href="https://schools.utah.gov/">Utah State Board of Education</a> (USBE), and the <a href="{% link index.html %}">Utah Automated Geographic Reference Center</a> (AGRC). The dataset includes public and private K-12 school locations with enrollment and demographics info by grade for public schools (charter and traditional) reported to the USBE. While some preschools are included, this is not a comprehensive statewide dataset for preschools.</p>
    <p>Schools marked as 'closed' have not been included in this data. More information regarding schools in Utah can be found on the <a href="https://schools.utah.gov/">Utah State Board of Education website</a>.</p>
    <p>The <code>Schools_PreKto12</code> will be updated annually in conjunction with USBE’s <a href="https://schools.utah.gov/data/reports">annual report</a> cycle.</p>
    <h5>Methodology</h5>
    <ul class="dotless">
      <li>Tabular Data</li>
        <li>The tabular portion of the data was downloaded from USBE's data page. The list of fields and the data in this dataset were generated by joining the following USBE reports:
            <ul>
                <li><a href="https://schools.utah.gov/data/reports?mid=1424&tid=6">2019-2020 School List</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://schools.utah.gov/data/reports?mid=1424&tid=4">Fall 2019-2020 Enrollment by Demographics and Grade Levels</a></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="dotless">
        <li>Geographic Data</li>
          <li>Point locations (geometry) were generated from USBE's school list using the <a href="http://api.mapserv.utah.gov/#geocoding">AGRC Geocoding Web API</a> which utilizes address point and street centerline reference data. These were then compared to the previous 2016-2017 school layer’s locations with the best position chosen. Unmatched addresses were hand placed with assistance from publicly available, commercial mapping and search web apps.</li>
