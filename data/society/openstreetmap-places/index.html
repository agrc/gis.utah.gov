    <p>This point data was generated and filtered from OpenStreetMap and is intended to represent places 
        of interest in the state of Utah.  These may include businesses, restaurants, places of worship, 
        airports, parks, schools, event centers, apartment complexes, hotels, car dealerships, etc., etc., …almost anything 
        that you can find in OpenStreetMap (OSM).  There are over 23,000 features in the original dataset 
        (March 2022) and users can directly contribute to it through <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org">openstreetmap.org</a>.  This data is updated 
        approximately once every month and will likely continue to grow over time with user activity.
    </p>
    <h4 id="DataCreation">Data Creation Process</h4>
    <p>The OSM Places layer is created by a Python script that pulls statewide OSM data from a nightly archive provided by 
        <a href="https://download.geofabrik.de/index.html">Geofabrik</a>.  The archive data contains nearly 20 shapefiles, some that 
        are relevant to this dataset and some that aren't.  The OSM Places layer is built by filtering the polygon and point 
        data in those shapefiles down to a single point feature class with specific categories and attributes that UGRC 
        determines would be of widest interest.  The polygon features (buildings, areas, complexes, etc.) are converted to 
        points using an internal centroid.  Spatial filtering is done as the data from multiple shapefiles is combined 
        into a single layer to minimize the occurrence of duplicate features.  (For example, a restaurant can be represented 
        in OSM as both a point of interest and as a building polygon.  The spatial filtering helps reduce the chances that 
        both of these features are present in the final dataset.)  Additional de-duplication is performed by using the 
        'block_id' field as a spatial index, ensure that no two features of the same name exist within a census block.  
        Then, additional fields are created and assigned from UGRC's SGID data (county, city, zip, nearby address, etc.) 
        via point-in-polygon analysis.  A numeric check is done on the 'name' field to remove features where the name is 
        less than 3 characters long or more than 50% numeric characters.  This eliminates several features derived from 
        the buildings layer where the 'name' is simply an apartment complex building number (ex: 3A) or house number 
        (ex: 1612).  Finally, additional attributes (osm_addr, opening_hours, phone, website, cuisine, etc.) are pulled 
        from the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API">Overpass API</a> and joined to the filtered data using 
        the 'osm_id' field as the join key.

    <h4 id="FieldDescriptions">Field Descriptions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>addr_dist - the distance (m) to the nearest UGRC address point within 25 m
        <li>osm_id - the feature ID in the OSM database
        <li>category - the feature's data class based on the 4-digit code and tags in the OSM database
        <li>name - the name of the feature in the OSM database
        <li>county - the county the feature is located in (assigned from UGRC's county boundaries)
        <li>city - the city the feature is located in (assigned from UGRC's municipal boundaries)
        <li>zip - the zip code of the feature (assigned from UGRC's approximation of zip code boundaries)
        <li>block_id - the census block the feature is located in (assigned from UGRC's census block boundaries)
        <li>ugrc_addr - the nearest address (within 25 m) from the UGRC address point database
        <li>disclaimer - a note from UGRC about the ugrc_addr field
        <li>lon - the approximate longitude of the feature, calculated in WGS84 [EPSG:4326] (for the most precision, it is recommended that the feature's geometry is used instead of this field)
        <li>lat - the approximate latitude of the feature, calculated in WGS84 [EPSG:4326] (for the most precision, it is recommended that the feature's geometry is used instead of this field)
        <li>amenity - the amenity available at the feature (if applicable), often similar to the category
        <li>cuisine - the type of food available (if applicable), multiple types are separated by semicolons (;)
        <li>tourism - the type of tourist location, if applicable (zoo, viewpoint, hotel, attraction, etc.)
        <li>shop -  the type of shop, if applicable
        <li>website - the feature's website in the OSM database, if available
        <li>phone - the feature's phone number(s) in the OSM database, if available
        <li>open_hours - the feature's operating hours in the OSM database, if available
        <li>osm_addr - the feature's address in the OSM database, if available
      </ul>
