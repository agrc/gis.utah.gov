    <p>Utah DEQ Brownfields Targeted contains the coordinates of Brownfields Projects targeted for cleanup. These

      property, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence
      of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. Cleaning up and reinvesting in these properties takes
      development pressures off of undeveloped open land, and both improves and protects the environment. For more
