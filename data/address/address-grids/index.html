title: Utah Addressing Systems (Address Grids)
categories: []
---
<p>James Wingate, formerly of Blue Stakes, has compiled most of the address coordinate system descriptions listed below.
  UGRC will update this list as more information is brought to our attention. If you have additional information or
  corrections to contribute, please <a
    href="{{ site.github.repository_url }}/edit/master/{{ page.path }}">contribute</a> {% include contact.html
  subject=page.title contact=site.data.contacts.address_grids text='or email' %}</p>
<p>UGRC has created a <a href="{% link data/location/address-data/index.html %}#AddressSystemQuadrants">polygon feature
    class</a> that approximates the boundaries of each local address coordinate system (ACS) and each quadrant (NE, NW,
  SE, SW) within each local ACS.</p>
<h2 class="text-left">Beaver County</h2>
<div>Municipalities with their own address origins</div>
<ul>
  <li>Beaver – has own origin – Main St/Hwy 160 (0 E/W) and Center St/Hwy 21 (0 N/S)
  <li>Milford – has own origin – Main St/Hwy 257 (0 E\W) and Center St/ Hwy 21 (0 N/S)
  <li>Minersville – has own origin – Main St (0 N/S) and Center St/Hwy 130 (0 E/W)
</ul>
<p>Some county addresses count off of Beaver. There may be different origins for the county addresses, but it’s hard to
  tell with all the null roads. Search 9300 S (8500 N next road north).<br />

<h7><strong>Address numbers for all of Cache County</strong></h7>
<ul class="dotless no-padding">
  <li><strong>Even</strong> – always on South and East side of the street
  <li><strong>Odd</strong> – always on North and West side of the street
</ul>
<p>This is <em>different</em> from most cities, where even addresses are typically on the right and odds on the left as
  you move outward from the address origin. This is the case for the entire county, although supposedly a few addresses
  have deviated.</p>

<h2 class="text-left">Duchesne County</h2>
<div>Municipalities with their own address origins</div>
<ul>
  <li>Duchesne – intersection of Main St (0 N/S) and Center St (0 E/W)
  <li>Myton – intersection of Main St (0 N/S) and Center St (0 E/W)
  <li>Roosevelt – intersection of Lagoon St (0 N/S) and State St (0 E/W)
</ul>
<div>Municipalities that count from Unincorporated County address origin located at: Intersection of South Cove Rd/US 40
  [200 N Roosevelt] (0 N/S) and State St (0 E/W) in Roosevelt</div>
<ul>
  <li>Altamont
  <li>Tabiona
</ul>
<p>The unincorporated county origin covers all of Duchesne County except for the areas within Duchesne City, Myton and
  Roosevelt city boundaries. A significant portion of Uintah County also counts from this origin, including the
  municipality of Ballard Town and roughly 25% of the unincorporated area.</p>
<p>Roosevelt City grid and County grid both have same 0 E/W, but their 0 N/S locations differ by two blocks. This can be
  slightly confusing, as evidenced by traveling north along State St in Roosevelt. Proceeding north from Lagoon St,
  after a few blocks you will hit 500 N (City), then 600 N (City) and then 500 N (County). This is because the county
  origin begins two blocks farther north than the city origin.</p>

  <li>Springdale – No prefix or suffix directionals used. There is also no official address origin. If there was an
    origin, it would be where Zion Park Blvd (SR 9) meets the north city boundary line, which is also the border of Zion
    National Park. Zion Park Blvd (ZPB) would be the zero road, where addresses along the cross streets get larger as
    they get farther away from ZPB. But there is no standard of how far addresses count; the addresses could jump by 2
    from house to house or by 50. All segments of ZPB have S as the prefix directional, since the origin would be the
    north city boundary. E-911 is uses address points for Springdale. (per Tom Dansie – Director of Community
    Development – 10/29/08)
