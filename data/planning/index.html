<p>The list shown below includes dataset names, descriptions, and links to some of the most important statewide and
  regional data resources for transportation planning, land use planning, and economic development. It also includes
  some datasets that represent the geography of notable formal plans and proposals.</p>
<p>The list is meant as a starting point and users are encouraged to reach out to agencies, local government, and
  further search across UGRC's State Geographic Information Database for additional existing data. The overall objective
  of keeping this list is to connect others to valuable resources efficiently and avoid duplicative work.</p>
