    <p>As part of developing and updating the State Water Plan, the <a href="https://water.utah.gov/">Utah Division of
        Water Resources</a> collects water-related land use data for the entire state. This data includes the types and
      extent of irrigated crops as well as information concerning phreatophytes, wet/open water areas, dry land
      agriculture and residential/industrial areas.</p>
    <p>The data produced by the water-related land use program are used for various planning purposes. Some of these
      include: determining cropland water use, evaluating irrigated land losses and conversion to urban uses, planning
      for new water development, estimating irrigated acreages for any area, and developing water budgets. Additionally,
      the data are utilized by many other state and federal agencies. Water-related land use can be used to depict
      Irrigation type (Irrigated, Sub-Irrigated, Non-Irrigated, Riparian, Urban, etc).</p>
    <p>See the accompanying FGDC metadata for description of extensive Land Use, Irrigation Type, and Vegetation Cover
      codes. There are no constraints or warranties with regard to the use of this dataset.</p>
