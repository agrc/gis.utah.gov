    <p>The Utah NG911 GIS Database contains datasets conforming to the National Emergency Number Association (NENA)
      standards for the NG9-1-1 Data Model. In addition to the required Road Centerlines, Address Points, PSAP Boundary,
      Law Enforcement, Fire, and Emergency Medical Service datasets, the database also contains many of the recommended
      datasets including: Cell Towers, Counties, Hydrology Line, Streams, Lakes, Incorporated Municipalities, Mile
      Markers, Railroads, States, and Unincorporated Communities. This database also contains the recommended Road
      Centerlines’ Alias Names table and the Address Points’ Landmark Names Alias tables.</p>
    <p>At first, UGRC will update the Utah NG911 GIS Database on a monthly cycle - in conjunction with our <a
        href="{% link data/transportation/roads-system/index.html %}">road update cycle</a>. This dataset has been
      updated on this cycle since December 2017. Updates will become more frequent when UGRC finalizes a mechanism to
      receive direct edits from the authoritative data editors (ex: PSAPs, jurisdictions, sheriff’s office, etc.). This
      mechanism will ensure up-to-date, accurate data that UGRC will push into the Utah NG911 GIS Database. Updates to
      this NG911 database will become much more frequent when that mechanism becomes operational. It is our goal to keep
      these datasets as up-to-date and accurate as possible.</p>

      updates. </p>
