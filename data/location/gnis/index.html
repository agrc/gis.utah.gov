abstract="The Geographic Names Information System (GNIS) was developed by the U.S. Geological Survey in cooperation with
the U.S. Board on Geographic Names (BGN), local governments and other interested organizations. The GNIS contains
information about physical and cultural geographic features in the United States and associated areas, both current and
historical, but not including roads and highways. The goal of GNIS is to meet major national needs regarding geographic
names and their standardization and dissemination."

    <p>This data contains polygons of commonly used places in mapping. It was created by UGRC from multiple sources
      including the GNIS point, municipalities, counties, political districts, zipcodes, etc.. The dataset is named
      <code>ZoomLocations</code> since the names and geometries can be used to zoom to common areas on a map with
      widgets like <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ugrc/sherlock">Sherlock</a>.
