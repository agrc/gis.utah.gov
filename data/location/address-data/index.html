    <p>Location.AddressPoints is a statewide dataset that contains address point data from all 29 Utah Counties. This
      dataset is a work in progress and some counties are more complete than others. One person in each county has been
      identified as the <a
        href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AkScYXX9W5INdFFRVHZkcWFYczd5MXhZYS1WTVN1elE&usp=sharing">Master
        Address List</a> (MAL) Authority to eliminate duplication of address point data and to clarify the main person
      of contact. UGRC is working with each MAL Authority to continually improve this data and work toward monthly
      updates.</p>
    <h5>Address Points in Action</h5>
    <p>The statewide address point layer is used as reference data for the <a
        href="{% link _posts/2013-05-10-utah-statewide-address-geocoding-web-service-upgrade.md %}">api.mapserv.utah.gov</a>
      address locators. You can also find the address points in many <a href="https://atlas.utah.gov">web mapping
        applications</a>.</p>
    <h5>Address Points as a Service</h5>
    <p>The address points are published as an <a

    <p>Location.AddressSystemQuadrants represents the local and countywide address system quadrants (NE, SE, SW, NW)
      throughout Utah. Addresses are assigned by local government addressing authorities using a defined addressing
      system, or grid. An addressing system consists of an origin point (0,0), a north-south axis, and an east-west
      axis, and a boundary within which addresses are assigned using this particular grid. This convention governs the
      assignment of addresses and is typically expressed as 100 address ranges per block or 800 address ranges per mile.
      Updates to this dataset are published periodically.</p>
