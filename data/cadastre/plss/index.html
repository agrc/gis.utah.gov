abstract="This dataset contains GIS mapping data representing the statewide Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and the Geographic Coordinate System Database (GCDB) for Utah. The GCDB Data was created to provide the BLM and the public with a set of geographic foundation data that accurately portrays the locations of PLSS corners. The GCDB data is based on the best and most current survey records available and uses known geographic positions of control stations within the PLSS network. This data is a key component of geographic data upon which all cadastral information will be assembled.</p>
<p>AGRC is working together with Counties and the BLM to continually enhance the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB). The GCDB map layers in the State Geographic Information Database (SGID) are a collection of geographic information representing the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) for the State of Utah.</p>
<p>All data users of PLSS data should be aware that AGRC is continually updating data available on the SGID ArcSDE database server and the SGID’s shapefile and file-geodatabase download site. <strong>This data is Utah PLSS Fabric Version 1.0 2017 of the Utah GCDB</strong>. This data set represents the GIS version of the Public Land Survey System. Updates are expected annually as horizontal control positions from published sources and global positioning system (GPS) observations are added. The GCDB grid is adjusted using various method of adjustment to determine the best geographic position of the survey points." %}

    <p>The State of Utah Public Land Survey System (PLSS) Fabric version 1.0 was generated from the Cadastral National Spatial Data Infrastructure (CadNSDI) version 2.0 which are the core or essential elements of cadastral information that provide the framework for building and using cadastral (land records) information nationwide.</p>
    <p>The PLSS data within the CadNSDI is typically survey data, control observations and other supplemental measurements, but in some cases survey information has not been completely abstracted or is not available and in these cases non Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB)  information has been used such as digitized maps or data from other sources.  In all cases the data steward is identified in the data sets and the metadata records.</p>
    <p>The PLSS Fabric is created and maintained through a collaborative partnership between the State of Utah Department of Technology Services, Automated Geographic Reference Center (AGRC); the State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA), and the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and BLM contractor Premier Data Solutions (Premier) with contributions from the Utah Mapping and Information Partnership (UMIP) through the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).</p>
    <p>Survey Control added to the PLSS Fabric is provided by the BLM Surveyors, County Surveyors, County Contract Surveyors and Private Surveyors throughout the State. Survey Control can be added or viewed using the <a href="http://mapserv.utah.gov/PLSS">AGRC PLSS Web Application.</a></p>

    <p><strong>The new release for this data layer is still under-construction as of August 2015</strong> CADASTRE.PLSSPoint_AGRC is a point dataset that repesents the AGRC version of the GCDB point layer. The layer PLSSPoint_GCDB on the SGID is the original source for this layer. It has been adjusted to fit county points where they exist. Adjusted points can be identified with the "Coord_Source" field. This field is populated with the source of the point position which in most cases is a county name. Any point for which this field is null has a position source of the Utah GCDB v1.2.</p>
    <h5>Important Notes for PLSSPoint_AGRC feature class</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>AGRC is continually updating the most current PLSS point data in a layer called PLSSPoint_AGRC. This data set is a combination of the BLM version 1.20 GCDB point data, the latest county PLSS points and all other PLSS point data submitted to the AGRC from any reliable alternative source. The data contains only points for section corners, quarter corners and center of sections unlike the GCDB that has point data on the fully intersected townships including sections, quarter corners and quarters of quarters.</li>
      <li>The PLSSPoint_AGRC points will match the GCDB line work where updates have been completed by the BLM, but points that have recently been added to the point layer the line work and points will not match. The line work is only updated by the BLM and available in the newest version of the GCDB.</li>
      <li>The PLSSPoint_AGRC points are routinely submitted to the BLM to be included in the next version of the GCDB that is commonly released annually. The next version of the GCDB is scheduled for release January 2013.</li>

    <p>CADASTRE.PLSSPoint_GCDB is a point dataset that depicts the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) for the State of Utah and are based on Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) coordinate data. This dataset was created to provide continuous cadastre data for the state of Utah. This data is Utah PLSS Fabric Version 1.0 2017 of the Utah GCDB. This data set represents the GIS Version of the Public Land Survey System. Updates are expected annually as horizontal control positions from published sources and global positioning system (GPS) observations are added. The primary source for the data is cadastral survey records housed by the BLM supplemented with local records and geographic control coordinates from states, counties as well as other federal agencies such as the USGS and USFS.The CADNSDI or the Cadastral Publication Data Standard is the cadastral data component of the NSDI. This is the publication guideline for cadastral data that is intended to provide a common format and structure and content for cadastral information that can be made available across jurisdictional boundaries, providing a consistent and uniform cadastral data to meet business needs that includes connections to the source information from the data stewards. The data stewards determine which data are published and should be contacted for any questions on data content or for additional information. The cadastral publication data is data provided by cadastral data producers in a standard form on a regular basis. Cadastral publication data has two primary components, land parcel data and cadastral reference data. It is important to recognize that the publication data are not the same as the operation and maintenance or production data. The production data is structured to optimize maintenance processes, is integrated with internal agency operations and contains much more detail than the publication data. The publication data is a subset of the more complete production data and is reformatted to meet a national standard so data can be integrated across jurisdictional boundaries and be presented in a consistent and standard form nationally.</p>

    <p>CADASTRE.PLSSTownships_GCDB is a polygon dataset. In the Public Land Survey System, a township refers to a unit of land, nominally 6 miles per side, usually containing 36 sections.This layer is based on Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) coordinate data. The locations of Public Land Survey System (PLSS) corners, as represented in geographic coordinate pairs, were derived from a variety of source documents, which include U.S. General Land Office and BLM survey plats/notes, as well as survey data obtained from other U.S. Government agencies, private sector survey firms, and local governments. The attributes assigned to PLSS polygons were taken from the BLM's Legal Land Description (LLD) data set, contained within the Legacy Rehost for the year 2000 (LR2000) automated records system. The coordinate data was produced by using control stations of known location, with varying degrees of accuracy, from various sources which include but are not limited to; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topological quadrangles and other sources, National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and US Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey (USC&amp;GS) Cooperative Base Network (CBN) control, Federal Base Network control (FBN), and Continuous Operating Reference Stations (CORS), and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is then analyzed and adjusted in concert with official survey data for any given geographic area. This data is a useful representation of the geometry and topology of parcels contained within the PLSS, but its application is intended for mapping purposes only. The GCDB data is not a substitute for a legal land survey.</p>

The coordinate data was produced by using control stations of known location, with varying degrees of accuracy, from various sources which include but are not limited to; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topological quadrangles and other sources, National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and US Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey (USC&amp;GS) Cooperative Base Network (CBN) control, Federal Base Network control (FBN), and Continuous Operating Reference Stations (CORS), and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is then analyzed and adjusted in concert with official survey data for any given geographic area. This data is a useful representation of the geometry and topology of parcels contained within the PLSS, but its application is intended for mapping purposes only. The GCDB data is not a substitute for a legal land survey.</p>
