abstract="This dataset contains GIS mapping data representing the statewide Public Land Survey System (PLSS) and the
Geographic Coordinate System Database (GCDB) for Utah. The GCDB Data was created to provide the BLM and the public with
a set of geographic foundation data that accurately portrays the locations of PLSS corners. The GCDB data is based on
the best and most current survey records available and uses known geographic positions of control stations within the
PLSS network. This data is a key component of geographic data upon which all cadastral information will be assembled.
</p>
<p>UGRC is working together with Counties and the BLM to continually enhance the Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB).
  The GCDB map layers in the State Geographic Information Database (SGID) are a collection of geographic information
  representing the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) for the State of Utah.</p>

<p>All data users of PLSS data should be aware that UGRC is continually updating data available from the SGID.
  <strong>This data is Utah PLSS Fabric Version 2.3 2020 of the Utah GCDB</strong>. This data set represents the GIS
  version of the Public Land Survey System. Updates are expected annually as horizontal control positions from published

    <p>The State of Utah Public Land Survey System (PLSS) Fabric version 1.0 was generated from the Cadastral National
      Spatial Data Infrastructure (CadNSDI) version 2.0 which are the core or essential elements of cadastral
      information that provide the framework for building and using cadastral (land records) information nationwide.</p>
    <p>The PLSS data within the CadNSDI is typically survey data, control observations and other supplemental
      measurements, but in some cases survey information has not been completely abstracted or is not available and in
      these cases non Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB) information has been used such as digitized maps or data
      from other sources. In all cases the data steward is identified in the data sets and the metadata records.</p>
    <p>The PLSS Fabric is created and maintained through a collaborative partnership between the State of Utah
      Department of Technology Services, Utah Geospatial Resource Center (UGRC); the State of Utah School and
      Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA), and the United States Department of the Interior, Bureau of Land
      Management (BLM) and BLM contractor Premier Data Solutions (Premier) with contributions from the Utah Mapping and
      Information Partnership (UMIP) through the Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ).</p>
    <p>Survey Control added to the PLSS Fabric is provided by the BLM Surveyors, County Surveyors, County Contract
      Surveyors and Private Surveyors throughout the State. Survey Control can be added or viewed using the <a
        href="https://plss.utah.gov">UGRC PLSS Web Application.</a></p>
    <h5>Important Notes for PLSS Fabric Version 2.3</h5>
    <ul>
      <li>The Fabric works best with ArcMap 10.4.1. Improvements were made in ArcMap 10.5 in 2017.</li>
      <li>The newest Version 2.3 includes updates from BLM, UGRC and SITLA.</li>
      <li>Continuous updates will be made to the PLSS Fabric and are available for download from this page. Please
        return frequently to download the latest version of the Fabric with new control added.</li>
      <li>Data for CadNSDI Versions and the GCDB downloadable layers (soon to be Utah PLSS) are published from the

    <p>PLSSPoint_GCDB is a point dataset that depicts the Public Land Survey System (PLSS) for the State of Utah and are

        href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1E3ks5ndjMKiZqS5b7N6a3_1paJK0jHi_/view?usp=sharing">data</a> for the state
      of Utah. This data is Utah PLSS Fabric Version 2.3 2020 of the Utah GCDB. This data set represents the GIS Version
      of the Public Land Survey System. Updates are expected annually as horizontal control positions from published
      sources and global positioning system (GPS) observations are added. The primary source for the data is cadastral
      survey records housed by the BLM supplemented with local records and geographic control coordinates from states,
      counties as well as other federal agencies such as the USGS and USFS. The CADNSDI or the Cadastral Publication
      Data Standard is the cadastral data component of the NSDI. This is the publication guideline for cadastral data
      that is intended to provide a common format and structure and content for cadastral information that can be made
      available across jurisdictional boundaries, providing a consistent and uniform cadastral data to meet business
      needs that includes connections to the source information from the data stewards. The data stewards determine
      which data are published and should be contacted for any questions on data content or for additional information.
      The cadastral publication data is data provided by cadastral data producers in a standard form on a regular basis.
      Cadastral publication data has two primary components, land parcel data and cadastral reference data. It is
      important to recognize that the publication data are not the same as the operation and maintenance or production
      data. The production data is structured to optimize maintenance processes, is integrated with internal agency
      operations and contains much more detail than the publication data. The publication data is a subset of the more
      complete production data and is reformatted to meet a national standard so data can be integrated across
      jurisdictional boundaries and be presented in a consistent and standard form nationally.</p>

    <p>plss_township_gcdb is a polygon dataset. In the Public Land Survey System, a township refers to a unit of land,
      nominally 6 miles per side, usually containing 36 sections.This layer is based on Geographic Coordinate Data Base
      (GCDB) coordinate data. The locations of Public Land Survey System (PLSS) corners, as represented in geographic
      coordinate pairs, were derived from a variety of source documents, which include U.S. General Land Office and BLM
      survey plats/notes, as well as survey data obtained from other U.S. Government agencies, private sector survey
      firms, and local governments. The attributes assigned to PLSS polygons were taken from the BLM's Legal Land
      Description (LLD) data set, contained within the Legacy Rehost for the year 2000 (LR2000) automated records
      system. The coordinate data was produced by using control stations of known location, with varying degrees of
      accuracy, from various sources which include but are not limited to; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topological
      quadrangles and other sources, National Geodetic Survey (NGS) and US Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey (USC&amp;GS)
      Cooperative Base Network (CBN) control, Federal Base Network control (FBN), and Continuous Operating Reference
      Stations (CORS), and Global Positioning System (GPS) data, which is then analyzed and adjusted in concert with
      official survey data for any given geographic area. This data is a useful representation of the geometry and
      topology of parcels contained within the PLSS, but its application is intended for mapping purposes only. The GCDB
      data is not a substitute for a legal land survey.</p>

    <p>plss_quarter_sections_gcdb is a polygon dataset. Quarter section data is commonly an aliquot part of a section
      160 acres in size. Sections are divided by running straight lines from the fixed quarter section corners to the

    <p>plss_quarter_quarter_sections_gcdb is a polygon dataset. Second division (QuarterQuarter) data is commonly an
      aliquot part of quarter sections but could be a lot or other division. GCDB base attribute data was used to create
      the second division feature class. Lots were dissolved to the section level. <code>Survey_type</code>:
      <code>B</code> (aliquot parts less than 40 acres) for geopolitical splits were attributed as
      <code>Survey_type</code>: <code>A</code>. This data is derived from the PLSS Intersected feature class of the Utah
      PLSS Fabric GISv2.3 2020. This layer is based on Geographic Coordinate Data Base (GCDB) coordinate data. The
      locations of Public Land Survey System (PLSS) corners, as represented in geographic coordinate pairs, were derived
      from a variety of source documents, which include U.S. General Land Office and BLM survey plats/notes, as well as
      survey data obtained from other U.S. Government agencies, private sector survey firms, and local governments. The
      attributes assigned to PLSS polygons were taken from the BLM's Legal Land Description (LLD) data set, contained
      within the Legacy Rehost for the year 2000 (LR2000) automated records system. The coordinate data was produced by
      using control stations of known location, with varying degrees of accuracy, from various sources which include but
      are not limited to; U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) topological quadrangles and other sources, National Geodetic
      Survey (NGS) and US Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey (USC&amp;GS) Cooperative Base Network (CBN) control, Federal Base
      Network control (FBN), and Continuous Operating Reference Stations (CORS), and Global Positioning System (GPS)
      data, which is then analyzed and adjusted in concert with official survey data for any given geographic area. This
      data is a useful representation of the geometry and topology of parcels contained within the PLSS, but its
      application is intended for mapping purposes only. The GCDB data is not a substitute for a legal land survey.

    <p>The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter x,y coordinate precision; 0.001
      mile m coordinate precision). There are no constraints or warranties with regard to the use of this dataset. Users
      are encouraged to attribute content to UGRC. This statewide dataset is maintained by UGRC in partnership with the
      BLM and local government. The geographic coordinates and their associated products are NOT legal land survey
      records. The coordinates can NOT be used as a substitute for a legal land survey. They can be used for record
      keeping, mapping, graphics and planning purposes only. No warranty is made by the Bureau of Land Management for
      use of the data for purposes not intended by BLM.</p>
    <p>Updates were made to Quarter Quarter Sections in Utah County to add quarter-quarter sections to areas that were
      not broken down less than the Section level. These are labeled as SECDIVTYP = Z and SECDIVTXT = Unsurveyed
      Unprotracted. They were added, using information from points collected by county surveyors, that is in the data
      and extrapolating information from adjoining sections wherever possible. They are still areas that could not be
      interpreted well enough and they were left empty, beyond the section level.
      In the future this data will continue to be carried in this feature class but not incorporated into the official
      PLSS Fabric.</p>
