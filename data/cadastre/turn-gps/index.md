abstract="<p>The Utah Reference Network (TURN) GPS is a GNSS network of permanently located GPS receivers, installed across the state, to generate real time high accuracy GPS positioning. TURN GPS uses the Trimble PIVOT VRS Platform. TURN GPS is used for a range of precision GPS applications including surveying, engineering, construction, and GIS data collection. The current cost is $600 for each user login and is good for a full year from the sign up date.</p>
<p>The Coordinate Reference Frame for this network is <strong>NAD83(2011)(EPOCH:2010.0000.)</strong>. The Latitude, Longitude and Ellipsoidal Height of each reference station was calculated by processing 24 hour files using the National Geodetic Survey (NGS) Online Positioning User Service (OPUS) Projects application.</p>
<p>Eighteen NGS Continually Operating Reference Stations (CORS) were selected along the perimeter and interior of the network and were constrained to the published coordinates to conduct the final adjustment of the network coordinates.</p>" %}

##### Connections from Source Table

Connections from the Source Table:
For Trimble units we have three different connections.
VRS_CMR works older Trimble unit
VRS_CMRp works with Trimble units that are newer but may not have the latest updates to the firmware.
VRS_CMRx works with the newest up to date Trimble units
All of these give you the network solution.

For non-Trimble units we have two different connections.
VRS_RTCM23 works older non-Trimble unit
VRS_RTCM31 works with non-Trimble units
Both of these give you the network solution.

MS_CMR, MS_CMRP these are for connecting to single base when you are on the edge of the network or not getting a strong network solution. System will automatically find the closest station and connect you.
