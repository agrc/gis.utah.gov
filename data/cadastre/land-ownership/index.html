Cadastre.LandOwnership feature class depicts land ownership status and areas of responsibility for the State of Utah
surface lands at a scale of 1:24,000. Maintenance of this data layer is performed by a cooperative federal and state
effort between the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the State of Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands
Administration (SITLA). Cadastre.LandOwnership is a statewide dataset of land ownership status, and therefore is a
compilation of all surface land ownership administration, and designation categories. Both the Utah School and
Institutional Trust Lands Administration (SITLA) and the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) update this dataset regularly.
Revisions of the dataset are made available weekly. SITLA publishes a <a
  href='https://gis.trustlands.utah.gov/server/rest/services/Ownership/UT_SITLA_Ownership_LandOwnership_WM/FeatureServer'>feature
  service</a> via their ArcGIS Server. Standard colors are recommended when displaying this feature class. A layer file
containing the standard color scheme is available by contacting SITLA GIS staff directly by {% include contact.html
subject=page.title contact=site.data.contacts.sitla hide-punctuation=true text='contacting' %}, or visiting <a
  href='https://trustlands.utah.gov'>https://trustlands.utah.gov</a>.

    <h6>DESIG</h6>
    <p><em>Describes the "Type" of Land Use or Designation. This field characterizes general land management
        designations for parcels of land and describes how, or for what use the land is to be managed (ex: Designated as
        Wilderness, National Park, State Park). This field can accommodate, if necessary, further withdrawals, leases,
        or permits designated by the ADMIN. E.g. If the USFS places a withdrawal on a parcel, i.e. for wilderness
        designation, the DESIG field can be used to account for this case. However, only a single designation can be
        addressed in the DESIG field; we cannot account for multiple withdrawals, leases, or permits on a parcel in this
        data standard. The data steward or editor must decide the most pertinent information to describe in the
        <code>DESIG</code> field.</em></p>
