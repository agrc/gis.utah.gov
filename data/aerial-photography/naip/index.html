National Agricultural Imagery Program</a> is color aerial photography typically collected every 2 or 3 years in the
middle of the summer. Starting in 2006 the acquisitions have been statewide. The resolution is usually 1 meter with a
horizontal positional accuracy of -/+ 5 meters. The 2018 & 2021 imagery is .6 meter (60 centimeter) resolution with a horizontal
positional accuracy of -/+ 4 meters. For more information about the history of the NAIP collections take a look at this

      National Agricultural Imagery Program</a>
      (NAIP) 3-band aerial photography for Utah in Mr. Sid county mosaics.
      The imagery is .6-meter (60 centimeter) resolution and was collected in the summer and fall of 2021.
      The date the photography was flown can be found in the <code>IDATE</code> field in the associated shapefile.
      Be aware some of the larger counties (ex. San Juan, Millard, Tooele and Box Elder) are no longer split
      into multiple parts and their file size is upwards of 4 to 7 GB. The images have a UTM NAD83 meters projection.
