    <p>UGRC has a public-sector license to Hexagon's 30cm (~1-foot) and 15cm (~6-inch) aerial photography. The 30cm
      Hexagon imagery is a higher-resolution copy of the statewide 2018 NAIP imagery. The 15cm imagery was flown in
      November 2019 and covers Logan, St. George, and the Wasatch Front. The 30cm imagery has a horizontal positional
      accuracy of 2.6 meters (CE90) while the 15cm imagery has an accuracy of 1.07m (CE90).</p>

    <p>High Resolution Orthophotography (HRO) is color aerial photography collected in the spring or fall for select
      areas in Utah. The resolution is 1 foot or better with a horizontal positional accuracy of +- 75cm for 2006 and
      2009 and +- 37.5cm for 2012 imagery. The 2003 Urban Area Orthoimagery (UAO) is considered part of the HRO
      collection. Currently there is HRO imagery from 2003, 2006, 2009, and 2012.</p>

        National Agriculture Imagery Program</a> (NAIP) typically collects color aerial photography every 2 or 3 years
      in the middle of the summer. Starting in 2006 the acquisitions have been statewide. The resolution is usually 1
      meter with a horizontal positional accuracy of 5 meters although since 2018 the resolution is .6 meter with a 
      horizontal positional accuracy of 4 meters. In addition to the 3-band RGB color imagery, there is a
      color-infrared dataset from 2006 and a 3-band and 4-band dataset from 2009. The 2011 dataset is 4-band for the
      TIFF images and 3-band for the county mosaics. The 2014, 2016, 2018, & 2021 datasets are 3-band with separate
      single-band image tiles for the 4th band for the TIFF images, and the county mosaics are 3-band. Currently there
      is NAIP imagery from 2003, 2004, 2006, 2009, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2018, and 2021.</p>

      cases the DOQs are 0.5 meter, color, or 4-band. The boundaries of the imagery tiles correspond to the boundaries
      of 1:24,000 US Geological Society (USGS) topographic maps. The 1990s collection is statewide.</p>
