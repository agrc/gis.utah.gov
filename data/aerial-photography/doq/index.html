abstract="A Digital Orthophoto Quadrangle (DOQ) is a digital image that has the properties of an orthographic projection, derived from a digitized perspective aerial photograph or other remotely sensed image data by differential rectification so that image displacements caused by camera tilt and terrain relief are removed. The DOQ combines the image characteristics of the original photograph with the georeferenced qualities of a map. Ground features are displayed in their true position, allowing for the direct measurement of distance, areas, angles, and positions." %}

    <p>AGRC has a statewide coverage of 1-meter resolution Black and White Digital Orthophoto Quads (DOQs). All tiles have a UTM NAD83 Zone 12 North meters projection. The <code>.jpg</code> files are usually between 30 to 40 MB. <strong>The <code>.met</code> file is all the original header information from the image and contains the dates the images were flown and photographed.</strong> Some DOQs have <a href="{{ "/downloads/DOQ_two_vintages.txt" | prepend: site.baseurl }}">2 vintages</a> of dates the images were flown. Usually one image will be from 1993 and another 1997 or newer.
