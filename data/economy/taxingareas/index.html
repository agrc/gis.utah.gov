    <p>Tax Areas 2021 contains the set of taxing areas for the year, formed by each unique 2-dimensional intersection of incorporated
      taxing entities in Utah. Each taxing area represents at least a county and school district as members of these two
      categories cover the entire state. The property tax levy rate within a tax area should be the same for a specified
      property type within that area. 2022 rates have not been done yet.  That won't be till September.</p>
    <p>There are no constraints or warranties with regard to the use of this dataset.</p>

    <p>Tax Entities 2021 contains Tax Entities in Utah. Tax Entities are incorporated bodies that have the power to levy
      a local property tax such as school districts, counties, cities, special service districts, redevelopment
      districts, library districts, cemetery districts, and mosquito abatement districts. The Tax Entities 2021 dataset
      does not represent exact legal boundaries, but rather a set of boundaries used for the administrative purposes by
      the USTC Property Tax Division for centrally assesses properties (quarries, rail, linear utilities, etc).</p>
