abstract="These datasets depict oil and gas well surface points, units and fields polygons from the <a href='https://www.ogm.utah.gov/'>Utah Department of Natural Resources, Oil, Gas and Mining Division</a>. <strong>Note:</strong> On June 1, 2017, the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining retired 5 old databases and went online with a new database. This prompted many changes to the data field names and content previously provided in the AGRC files. This new database was developed by contractors sponsored in part by the U.S. Department of Energy and the Ground Water Protection Council and provides the opportunity for the Division to collect more descriptive down-hole information for each wellbore permitted and drilled. Initially, much of the down-hole information will not be available because there was no place to save it in the previous databases. Eventually, as new wells are drilled and old legacy data is entered, more descriptive data will become available for the wells in Utah." %}

    <p>This dataset depicts oil and gas well points in Utah from the Utah Department of Natural Resources, Oil Gas and Mining Division. The dataset contains the API code, well and company name, account number, filed number, field name, elevation, locations coordinates, lease numbers, well type and status, total cumulative oil, gas and water, and more. The path (OilGasWells_Paths) and down holes (OilGasWells_DownHoles) for horizontally-drilled wells are available as a separate feature classes.</p>

    <p>This dataset depicts oil and gas field units in Utah from the U.S. Bureau of Land Management (BLM). The dataset contains the unit name, operator, status, district and more. It is available via <a href="https://gis.blm.gov/utarcgis/rest/services/Energy/BLM_UT_min_OGUnitAgreements_MapService/MapServer/"> a BLM Map Service REST end point</a>. Most "Units" in the state of Utah are established and regulated by the BLM. We are therefore providing this link to their "Utah Oil and Gas Unit Agreements" GIS Layer. This information is better maintained by the BLM than the data layer previously posted here, which was occasionally updated by the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining with second-hand information. However, please be aware that none of the state designated oil and gas units/area's (i.e. OGM Board Designated units and enhanced recovery units) are present in the data set from the BLM. If you need these data, please contact <a href="https://www.ogm.utah.gov/">the Utah Division of Oil, Gas and Mining</a>.
