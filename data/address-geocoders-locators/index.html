webapp="https://api.mapserv.utah.gov" abstract="Adding a geographic point for an address is a fundamental GIS task. To handle this task, UGRC has created many services and tools to cater to the wide geocoding user base. Starting from the ground up, UGRC helps maintain statewide address points and roads datasets. These two datasets are the foundation for geocoding. Building on top of the reference data, UGRC creates and maintains ArcGIS Locators. Locators are where most of the magic happens - taking the input data and finding a location from the reference data. These locators are available for download on this page. With the reference data and the locators blocks in place, UGRC can put together geocoding systems and tools. The UGRC WebAPI is a web service that can geocode over the web via http. Users can send requests via their favorite programming language, application, or web browser. This service has intimate Utah addressing knowledge to get the best results out of user input and is the recommended way to geocode addresses. UGRC also provides pre-built clients to use the Web API that can be downloaded below. UGRC hopes to have the data and tools ready for your needs to geocode." %}

      This custom toolbox created by the UGRC allows ArcGIS users to geocode a
      table of addresses. The geocoding tool makes use of the
      <a href="https://api.mapserv.utah.gov">UGRC Web API</a> to perform the
      geocoding. A complimentary
      <a href="https://developer.mapserv.utah.gov">API key</a> will need to be
      obtained to run the tool.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tool's documentation is maintained in
      <a href="https://github.com/agrc/geocoding-toolbox/">GitHub</a>. Please
      refer to the readme for the most current information on downloading and
      running the tool. ArcGIS Desktop versions of this tool can be found in the
      <a href="https://github.com/agrc/geocoding-toolbox/tree/py-2">py-2</a>
      branch.
    </p>
    <p>
      We've put together a
      <a href="https://vimeo.com/539838894">how-to video</a> explaining the
      basics of using the toolbox.

The endpoints provided by the API are a great way to add geospatial functionality to your web pages and applications or desktop workflows. You will be able to geocode addresses and search all the data in the SGID. To get started,

There are also examples of geocoding in <a href="https://github.com/agrc/GeocodingSample">multiple programming languages</a>. To use the UGRC API, you will need a general understanding of programming. If you are new to programming, or do not know how to program, you can you one of the prebuilt clients.

      AGRC_RoadsLocator is an ArcGIS 10 address locator that references the
      statewide Transportation.Roads feature class and uses the right and left
      zip code fields and/or the right and left address systems fields for zone.
      This address locator is built using an alternate names table, as
      recommended in NextGen 911 model. For example, Redwood Road is aliased as
      both Highway 68 and 1700 West. Read more about the

    <h5>Usage</h5>
    <p>
      The <code>.gcpk</code> packages are portable files that do not require the
      reference data: what is required of the data is included in the packaged.
      Once downloaded, <code>Unpack</code> the package and it is ready for use.
      You can <code>Unpack</code> the Locator Package in ArcCatalog by
      right-clicking on the package. Unpacking will always place the unpacked
      locator in your user profile <code>..\My Documents\ArcGIS\Packages</code>.
      Alternately, you can use ESRI's <code>Extract Package</code> tool and
      specify an output location. You can also drag the <code>.gcpk</code> file
      into ArcMap and it will unpack automatically.
