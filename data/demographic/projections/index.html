abstract="Utah's 4 Metropolitan Planning Organizations, together with UDOT for the state's non-urbanized areas, prepare small area demographic and employment projections to support the transportation planning process. These small area projections are developed from county-level totals released in 2017 by the <a href='https://gardner.utah.edu/demographics/population-projections/'>University of Utah Gardner Policy Institute (GPI)</a>. The MPO's and UDOT plan to release updated versions of these GIS layers in 2023, based on updated county projections released by GPI in January of 2022. Two small area geographies are available: <strong>Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) polygons</strong> and <strong>City Area polygons</strong>. TAZ's average about 1 square mile in size along the Wasatch Front but are larger in rural areas. City Areas are approximations of city boundaries built by combining TAZ polygons.<br /><br /><em>All links below point at ‘open data’ pages from which shapefiles, KML, CSV, and web services can be downloaded or utilized.</em>" %}
