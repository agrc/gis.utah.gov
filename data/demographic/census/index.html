    <p>The data in this section contains census blocks, census block groups, census tracts, census places, census
      counties, and the state boundary from the Census Bureau.</p>
    <p>Utah’s 2020 census geographic boundaries became available in February 2021. The Census Bureau will release the
      first set of corresponding demographic data in September 2021 (the 2020 Census Redistricting P.L. 94-171 Summary
      Files). Following that release, UGRC will append the demographic data to the existing 2020 geographies served on
      this page.</p>

    <p>UrbanAreasCensus2010 represents Census Bureau delineated urban areas that represent densely developed territory,
      encompassing residential, commercial, and other nonresidential urban land uses. In general, this territory
      consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the "urban
      footprint." There are two types of urban areas: urbanized areas (UAs) that contain 50,000 or more people and urban
      clusters (UCs) that contain at least 2,500 people, but fewer than 50,000 people (except in the U.S. Virgin Islands
      and Guam which each contain urban clusters with populations greater than 50,000). Each urban area is identified by
      a 5-character numeric census code that may contain leading zeroes.</p>

<h2 id="Commonly-Used Census Bureau Geography">Definitions for Commonly-Used Geography</h2>
<p>The Census Bureau provides data within two types of boundaries: statistical and legal. Statistical boundaries depend
  on population thresholds and typically follow features like roads, power lines, and rivers. Legal boundaries are more
  familiar, such as city, county, and state boundaries.</p>
<h5>Census tracts (statistical)</h5>
<p>Census tracts are small, relatively permanent subdivisions of a county designed to present and compare statistical
  data for areas of roughly equal population. Census tracts generally contain between 1,200 and 8,000 people, with an
  optimum population of 4,000. Spatially, a census tract will be smaller in higher-density areas, and larger in more
  sparsely populated areas. In higher-density areas, tracts can be considered approximately "neighborhood" sized. Census
  tracts subdivide the full area of counties and states, and never cross county boundaries.</p>
<h5>Block groups (statistical)</h5>
<p>Block groups are divisions of census tracts that generally contain between 600 and 3,000 people. A block group
  consists of a cluster of census blocks within the same census tract.</p>
<h5>Census blocks (statistical)</h5>
<p>Blocks are the smallest geographic areas and the basis for all tabulated census data. Blocks are statistical areas
  bounded by visible features, such as streets, road, streams, and railroad tracks, and by nonvisible boundaries, such
  as selected property lines and city, township, school district, and county limits. A block often represents a typical
  city block area, however, as with other statistical geographies, rural-area blocks may be very large in spatial size.
</p>
<h5>Places (legal or statistical)</h5>
<p>In Utah, census "places" include cities, towns, metro townships, and census-designated places (CDPs). The first three
  are legal boundaries in Utah, representing incorporated places that provide governmental functions for residents.
  Under Utah law, towns must have populations of at least 100, and cities at least 1,000. Metro townships are a new form
  of government created in Utah in 2015 with the passage of Senate Bill 199 (the Community Preservation Act), and exist
  only in Utah. CDPs are statistical boundaries delineated to provide data for recognizable places that are not legally
  incorporated. The “place” geography is not required to fully cover a county or state’s area, so areas that do not
  belong to any place are common. Places may cross county boundaries.</p>
