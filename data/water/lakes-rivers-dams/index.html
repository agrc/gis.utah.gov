abstract="The Lakes, Rivers, Streams & Springs data contains feature layers that are derived from the <a
  href='https://nhd.usgs.gov/data.html'>National Hydrography Dataset (NHD)</a>. The NHD is the surface water component
of the National Map created by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The NHD contains a feature-based database
that interconnects and uniquely identifies the stream segments or reaches that make up the nation's surface water
drainage system. NHD data was originally developed at 1:100,000-scale and exists at that scale for the whole country.
NHD data in it's entirety can be downloaded from the <a
  href='https://www.usgs.gov/core-science-systems/ngp/national-hydrography/access-national-hydrography-products'>USGS</a>.
</p>
<p>The USGS has <a href='https://www.usgs.gov/news/nhd-and-wbd-map-services-moving-cloud'>web-based map services</a> of
  the NHD and WBD. You are also able to view the USGS services on <a

    <p>Utah Lakes NHD is the recommended data layer for depicting Utah's lakes, reservoirs, and smaller features, etc.
      This data is derived from the National Hydrology Database (NHD) compiled by the USGS in partnership with UGRC and
      other states' GIS programs. The derivation and modification process has been performed by UGRC to provide a
      general purpose feature class of water bodies. Two fields have been added to this feature class (InUtah and
      IsMajor) and features have been split at the state boundary.</p>
