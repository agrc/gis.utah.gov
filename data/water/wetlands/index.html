    <p>The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s (USFWS) <a href="https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wetlands-inventory">National Wetlands Inventory</a>
      (NWI) program maintains a dataset depicting wetland
      and waterbody features across the United States. All features in the NWI dataset are described according to the
      Cowardin Classification System which uses coded values to describe vegetation communities, water, and disturbances
      present at each feature; codes can be interpreted <a href="https://www.fws.gov/program/national-wetlands-inventory/classification-codes">online</a>.
      Much of the original NWI dataset in Utah was mapped using imagery from the 1980s and may no longer accurately reflect
      current wetland locations. Several organizations, including the Utah Geological Survey, are actively conducting new
      mapping projects that update the NWI dataset for parts of the state.</p>

     <p>Newer mapping projects also map riparian areas, which are non-wetland areas along streams, rivers, and lakes that have distinct
       or distinctly more vigorous vegetation compared to adjacent upland areas. Riparian features are mapped alongside wetland features
       following the USFWS’s <a href="https://geodata.geology.utah.gov/pages/view.php?ref=75020&">A System For Mapping Riparian Areas
       in the United States</a>.</p>

      <p>Metadata are a description of individual wetland and riparian mapping projects, including the scale at which mapping was
        conducted and the imagery year used for the mapping. Most mapping projects include a supplemental report describing who
        completed the project, mapping methods, and types of features captured. Unlike wetlands mapping, which is available statewide,
        riparian mapping is only available for certain projects that are depicted by the riparian metadata polygons.</p>

      <p>Wetlands and riparian features are mapped using a combination of aerial imagery examination and on-the-ground assessment.
        NWI mapping may serve as an initial screen of likely wetland locations, but is not suited or intended to replace field-based
        wetland delineations necessary for the permitting process.</p>
