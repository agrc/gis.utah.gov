    <p>Utah Wetlands is derived from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service’s <a
        href="https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/">National Wetlands Inventory</a> (NWI). NWI attributes wetlands with codes
      from the Cowardin Classification System; codes can be interpreted <a
        href="https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/data/wetland-codes.html">online</a>. Cowardin classes in this derived layer
      have been split into separate System, Class, and Water Regime fields. Wetlands spatial data were produced from a
      combination of aerial imagery examination and on-the-ground assessment and are not meant to be used as the basis
      for a jurisdictional wetland delineation. The associated metadata for each wetland mapping project can be found
      below in Wetlands Mapping Projects.</p>

    <p>Wetland Mapping Projects are the associated metadata and descriptions of wetland areas that have been mapped.
      Wetland mapping project areas are generally represented by USGS topo quad boundaries or aggregations of topo
      quads, in some cases they are shown as a watershed boundary. This data includes the scale at which wetlands
      mapping was conducted and the imagery year used for the mapping. Some mapping projects include supplemental map
      information that describes the projects in more detail. The location of recent and ongoing mapping projects can be
      found in the <a href="https://www.fws.gov/wetlands/data/Mapper.html">Projects Mapper</a>.</p>
