    <p>Boundaries.Municipalities is a multi-purpose statewide dataset of municipal boundaries for cartography and approximate boundary identification.</p>
    <p>Boundaries.Municipalities boundaries are maintained by AGRC with the help of many state, county, and local entities. Changes and updates are through certification by the Lt. Governor’s Office sent in by City and County Recorders offices. All features are adjusted to the current Geographic Coordinate Database (GCDB) points.</p>
    <p>Data developed with coordinate geometry (COGO) from legal descriptions were used. When necessary the data was adjusted to conform to known physical features. This dataset does not represent exact legal boundaries, but, rather a set of boundaries used for the administrative purposes that conforms to logical &amp; administrative rules (e.g. no two cities or redevelopment areas may cover the same geographic extent).</p>
    <p>The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter coordinate precision).</p>
    <p>There are no constraints or warranties with regard to the use of this dataset. Users are encouraged to attribute content to: State of Utah, SGID.</p>
    <p>The municipal boundary dataset is maintained by AGRC in partnership with state and local government.</p>

    <p>In addition to the boundary of the state of Utah this dataset contains another larger boundary around the state that can be used for cartographic purposes to mask other data layers that extend past the boundary of the state.
