    <p>
      Zip Codes Boundaries represent an ongoing effort to approximate the
      geographic extents of five digit zip codes. The dataset was produced using
      a combination of methods and is based on several sets of source data.
      Editing methods include:
    </p>
    <ol style="display: inline-block">
      <li>
        Using local zipcode polygon data obtained from counties and cities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Identifying place locations (cities, towns, populated areas, etc.) from
        the postal service website and address information system (AIS) and
        building zipcode boundaries around these places.
      </li>

      <li>Using the 2000 Census TIGER line fileâ€™s zip code attributes.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      In addition, UGRC has used the locations of mailing addresses known to be
      valid to fine tune this dataset. The native spatial reference for this
      dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83 (0.01 meter coordinate precision). There
      are no constraints or warranties with regard to the use of this dataset.
