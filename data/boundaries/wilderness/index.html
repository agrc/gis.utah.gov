    <p>BOUNDARIES.USFSRoadlessInventory dataset contains all the National Forest Inventoried Roadless Areas. The IRA data was originally submitted to GSTC (Geometronics Service and Technical Center) by all the national forests through their Regional Office for the Forest Service's Roadless Area Conservation Initiative. The data was consolidated at the GSTC and used the Draft Environment Impact Statement. Between the draft and final states of the Environmental Impact Statement, the data was updated by the forests to reflect any corrections to Inventories Roadless Areas that were based on their existing forest plan. The data was also supplemented to include Special Designated Area information and to include Inventories Roadless Areas with Special Designated Areas. The data was resubmitted to the GSTC on July 21, 2000 for consolidation and the completed coverage was used in the Roadless Area Conservation Final Environmental Impact Statement. IRAs are based on completed forest plans, forest plans in revision where the agency has established an inventory (this information should be available in Appendix C of most foret plans) or other assessments that are completed and adopted by the agency. RARE II information was used in cases where a forest does not have a more current roadless inventory that was established using RARE II information.</p>

    <p>BOUNDARIES.Wilderness_BLMWSAs dataset contains all the BLM Wilderness Study Areas (WSAs). It also identifies lands that are not WSAs but were administratively endorsed for wilderness by the BLM in the 1991 wilderness study reports sent to the President and Congress. It also identifies acquired lands that are not WSAs, but are managed as if they were WSAs as a result of congressional direction.</p>
    <p>This layer is generally used for WSA identification and management, planning, and case-by-case actions where NEPA documentations is prepared. The data was digitized at the BLM Utah State Office from 1:24,000 USGS quadrangle paper maps using MOSS ADS. This data was also integrated with GCDB, Transportation, and Hydrography at 1:24,000 scale.</p>

    <p>BOUNDARIES.Wilderness_BLMSuitability data layer identifies which WSAs or portions of WSAs were recommended to Congress as suitable for wilderness designation. This layer is used as an historical reference only. This layer shows lands that was recomended to the President and Congress for wilderness designation as a result of the FLPMA Section 603 wilderness review mandate.</p>
