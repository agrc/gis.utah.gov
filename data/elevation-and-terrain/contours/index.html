    <p>ELEVATION.Contours500Ft is a statewide dataset of contour lines at a 500 foot interval for cartography and
      approximate elevation identification. Elevation information is stored in the 500 Foot contour lines in an
      attribute <code>ELEV</code> associated with each contour isoline.</p>
    <p>The native spatial reference for this dataset is UTM Zone 12N, NAD83. There are no constraints or warranties with
      regard to the use of this dataset. Users are encouraged to attribute content to: State of Utah, SGID. This contour
      dataset was created by UGRC.</p>

    <p>SGID10.ELEVATION.ContoursGeneralized200Ft are intended for general cartographic purposes and representing
      approximate elevation and terrain. Contours were created by applying a focal filter to a 30 meter DEM,
      reclassifying the DEM into 200 foot intervals and converting to polygons. Would you like to create your own
      contour polygons or are you simply curious how it was done? Read the <a
        href="/blog/2017-11-27-dumbing-down-terrain-with-contour-polygons">in-depth discussion</a> of how
      the contours were created and derived.</p>
